Hello Toke and Andrii,

I agree with Andrii here. In Google, we have several years of
experience building and using BPF RPC service. We delegate BPF
operations to this service. From our experience, the RPC approach is
quite limiting and becomes impractical for many BPF use cases.

For programs that do not require much user interaction, it works just
fine. It just loads and attaches the programs, that's all. The problem
is the programs that require much user interaction, for example, the
ones doing observability, which may often read maps or poll on bpf
ringbuf. Overhead and reliability of RPC is one concern. Another
problem is the BPF operations based on mmap, for example, directly
updating/reading BPF global variables as used in skeleton. We still
haven't figured out how to fully support bpf skeleton. We also haven't
figured out how to support BPF ringbuf using RPC. There are also
problems maintaining this service to catch up with some new features
in libbpf.

Anyway, I think the syscall interface has been heavily baked in libbpf
and bpf kernel interfaces today. There are many BPF use cases where
delegating all BPF operations to a service can't work well. IMHO, to
achieve a good balance between flexibility and security, some
abstraction that conveys controlled trust from priv to unpriv is
necessary. The idea of BPF token makes sense to me. With token, libbpf
interface requires only minimal change, unpriv user can call libbpf
and bpf syscall natively, wins on efficiency and less maintenance
burden for libbpf developers.

Thanks,
Hao
