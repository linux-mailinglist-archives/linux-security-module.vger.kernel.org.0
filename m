I agree, that would be nice, but it's legacy.

The approach taken by Landlock is to not break user space with kernel
updates, follow an incremental approach, and have a nice compatibility
story.  This is why a ruleset is created with a set of well-defined
"handled" access rights and restrictions.  Each new handled access right
or restriction must come with an explicit request from user space (e.g.
set new bits in struct landlock_ruleset_attr).

It would have been appealing to start from scratch, drop all access
rights, and then gradually implement access rights, but that would have
make Landlock unusable in most use cases.  Instead, we gradually extend
the scope of Landlock with well-defined and well-tested restrictions.
This approach eases the integration of Landlock and when new kernel
features are available, it's easy to update an integration to leverage
the new features.  From day one, Landlock has been useful, even if it
doesn't cover all use cases and environments.  When sandboxing a program
(or properly securing an OS), most of the time, the difficult part is to
get a good security architecture with proper privilege separation.  Once
this is done, it's much easier to gradually improve it.

We should probably improve the Landlock documentation, especially by
extending the warning block with some other relevant syscalls:
https://docs.kernel.org/userspace-api/landlock.html#filesystem-flags
