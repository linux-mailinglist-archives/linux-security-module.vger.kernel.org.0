DESCRIPTION
 
Linux Security Summit North America 2024 is a technical forum for
collaboration between Linux developers, researchers, and end-users.  Its
primary aim is to foster community efforts in deeply analyzing and solving
Linux operating system security challenges, including those in the Linux
kernel.

Presentations are expected to focus deeply on new or improved technology and
how it advances the state of practice for addressing these challenges.

The program committee currently seeks proposals for:
 
   * Refereed Presentations:
     45 minutes in length.
 
   * Panel Discussion Topics:
     45 minutes in length.
 
   * Short Topics:
     30 minutes in total, including at least 10 minutes discussion.
 
   * Tutorials
     90 minutes in length.

Tutorial sessions should be focused on advanced Linux security defense
topics within areas such as the kernel, compiler, and security-related
libraries.  Priority will be given to tutorials created for this conference,
and those where the presenter is a leading subject matter expert on the
topic.
 
Topic areas include, but are not limited to:

    * Access Control
    * Case Studies
    * Cryptography and Key Management
    * Emerging Technologies, Threats & Techniques
    * Hardware Security
    * IoT and Embedded Security
    * Integrity Policy and Enforcement
    * Open Source Supply Chain for the Linux OS
    * Security Tools
    * Security UX
    * Linux OS Hardening
    * Virtualization and Containers

Proposals should be submitted via:
