The chackpatch.pl limit is now 100 chars, so I hoped I would get away
with it :) Splitting conditionals always looks kinda awkward... But I
have no problem with changing it, if the VFS maintainers prefer that.
I would like to get at least *some* feedback from them before I respin
with just style changes...

Okay. I prefer the "Linus" format as well, but since different
subsystems still have their own opinions, I figured I'd just leave it
be... But again, I'll be happy to change it if VFS maintainers don't
object.
