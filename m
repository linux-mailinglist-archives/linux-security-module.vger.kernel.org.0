In your original patchset there was a lot of good discussion about
ways to solve, or mitigate, this problem using existing mechanisms;
while you disputed many (all?) of those suggestions, I felt that they
still had merit over your objections.   I also don't believe the
SELinux implementation of the set_mempolicy hook fits with the
existing SELinux philosophy of access control via type enforcement;
outside of some checks on executable memory and low memory ranges,
SELinux doesn't currently enforce policy on memory ranges like this,
SELinux focuses more on tasks being able to access data/resources on
the system.

My current opinion is that you should pursue some of the mitigations
that have already been mentioned, including seccomp and/or a better
NUMA workload configuration.  I would also encourage you to pursue the
OOM improvement you briefly described.  All of those seem like better
options than this new LSM/SELinux hook.
