Reviewed-by: Borislav Petkov <bp@suse.de>

However, as it has a user-visible impact and it is not an urgent thing
to have in the tree, I'd not queue this now but after the merge window
is done so that we have a maximum time of exposure in linux-next and we
can have ample time to addres fallout.

/me puts it on the list for after the merge window.

Thx.
