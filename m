Ah, right, IIRC that idea also came up in our internal discussions.  Note,
SGX would need to implement this option by checking for RIE in
sgx_encl_may_map(), as the process that built the enclave may not be the
same process that is running the enclave.

My biggest concern for allowing PROT_EXEC if RIE is that it would result
in #PF(SGX) (#GP on Skylake) due to an EPCM violation if the enclave
actually tried to execute from such a page.  This isn't a problem for the
kernel as the fault will be reported cleanly through the vDSO (or get
delivered as a SIGSEGV if the enclave isn't entered through the vDSO), but
it's a bit weird for userspace as userspace will see the #PF(SGX) and
likely assume the EPC was lost, e.g. silently restart the enclave instead
of logging an error that the enclave is broken.
