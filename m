Thanks for pulling the changes, I'm sorry the syscall table entries
for the LSM syscalls were not how you want to see them, but I'm more
than a little confused as to what exactly we did wrong here.  A more
detailed explanation would be helpful; if there is a doc somewhere
that explains the process, feel free to just drop a pointer.

I did provide a note in the pull request that based on linux-next
there were likely to be some conflicts in the syscall tables, but that
was evidently not sufficient, or we just added the syscall tables the
wrong way.  Your reply makes me believe we added the syscalls to the
arch tables the wrong way, but looking at your merge commit and the
files themselves (no helpful comments) I don't see anything obvious.
Quickly scanning the kernel docs doesn't reveal anything related
either, although I might be missing it.  The patches also didn't get
any comments regarding the syscall tables during review, and aside
from the numbering conflicts in linux-next, there were no comments
along the lines of "you need to do it this way" there either.

I want to do things The Right Way the next time around, but I need
some help to understand what that is ... ?
