Great.  I support that.  But the sentence

suggests that because CaitSith could be done in-tree, it doesn't need
to be loadable.  I'm saying that is a non sequitur.  It sounded like
that setence was meant to say "Because CaitSith could be in-tree, it
doesn't need to be =m.  Only out of tree modules need to be loadable."
