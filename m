You understood it perfectly, and managed to word in a much more clear
way than I did. I'll apply these changes in the next posting! Thanks.

Yes, that is true. I figured that this scenario was somewhat obvious,
as it is, at a high level, similar to PKI but I can certainly add it
explicitly.

Agreed. With these two functionalities, it does appear that IPE + DIGLIM
can be used for general purpose RPM-based OSes. I'll add a reference to
your recent posting (v3?) as a way to extend the functionality to general
purposes OSes in the next revision.

Yes, verifying the initial ramdisk is very difficult. "boot_verified",
is largely an assumption of trust as all the warning shows in the
documentation; it assumes the boot stack verified the initramfs somehow
(i.e. u-boot verified boot with it in the fitImage), and 'pins' (similar
to loadpin) the superblock to allow execution from that superblock.

In general, I would like to keep as much of the implementation of the
integrity mechanisms out of IPE as much as possible - there are likely
much better layers to implement new ways of providing integrity /
authenticity claims than at the lsm layer within IPE.

>>    * Reword and refactor patch 04/12 to [09/16]
>>    * Squash patch 05/12, 07/12, 09/12 to [10/16]
>>    * Squash patch 08/12, 10/12 to [11/16]
>>    * Change audit records to MAC region (14XX) from Integrity region (18XX)
>>    * Add FSVerity Support
>>    * Interface changes:
>>        1. "raw" was renamed to "pkcs7" and made read only
>>        2. "raw"'s write functionality (update a policy) moved to "update"
>>        3. introduced "version", "policy_name" nodes.
>>        4. "content" renamed to "policy"
>>        5. The boot policy can now be updated like any other policy.
>>    * Add additional developer-level documentation
>>    * Update admin-guide docs to reflect changes.
>>    * Kunit tests
>>    * Dropped CONFIG_SECURITY_IPE_PERMISSIVE_SWITCH - functionality can
>>      easily come later with a small patch.
>>    * Use partition0 for block_device for dm-verity patch
