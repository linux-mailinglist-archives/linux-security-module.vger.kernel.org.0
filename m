As I noted before, we followed the lead of SMACK and SeLinux, both of
which have their filesystems planted in /sys/fs.

Paul, FWIW, it may be worthwhile to add something to the LSM authors
guidance indicating that, moving forward, any control plane filesystem
functionality should be placed in securityfs, in order to avoid
wasting both developer and reviewer bandwidth.

Not the place for it here, but there is an interesting conversation
regarding Linux kernel development to be had, regarding the economic
barriers to mainstreaming code, that is posed by the 'Serving multiple
masters dilemma'.

A quick response to that, just for the historical record.

In a trust orchestrated system, the most security critical code
running are the TMA's, much more so than a TPM, since the TMA's
determine the security state of the kernel.  It has thus far seemed
wise to us to minimize the security scope and range of the
implementations as much as possible.

We are actually not advocating making the world use our format.

In my last reply we had suggested making the output format an option,
selected by the trust orchestrator at the time a modeling domain was
setup, given that by definition, the only thing that is going to be
reading that file is the trust orchestrator that sets it up.

That puts the compatibility onus on userspace and would provide a
mechanism for the kernel to deprecate formats.  Given the history of
this industry, JSON may be the rage now for the world's trusted
parsing tool, but who knows what the rage is going to be in five
years.  It wasn't too long ago that XML was thought to be all the
rage... :-)

JSON it will be than, unless the community wants the userspace
selection option.

Paul, since securityfs is officially something that is in your
approval domain, do you have any issues with having pseudo-files in
that filesystem urping out JSON?

In addition, Paul or anyone else reading this; does anyone have any
recommendations or preferences with respect to how the data is
marshalled?

Unless we hear otherwise we will proceed with the following
implementation:

- All of the JSON encoded information will be output as a single
linefeed delimited record.

- The record will be a JSON array with named structures that use the
same names as the field description names in the current event
description format.

- All of the existing key=value pairs will be used in their current
documented form but in 'key : value' format.

- JSON encoding will be applied only to the trajectory, forensics and
event description pseudo-files.  All other pseudo-files will continue
outputting a single ASCII value.

> And I don't see a link to the userspace tools anywhere, did I miss it?

The links were in the second to the last paragraph in the cover letter
for the patch series and in the TBDHTTRAD section of the TSEM LSM
documentation file: Documentation/admin-guide/LSM/tsem.rst

The project download directory is as follows:

ftp://ftp.enjellic.com/pub/Quixote

At the current time, the URL for the source is as follows:

ftp://ftp.enjellic.com/pub/Quixote/Quixote-1.4.tar.gz

Pre-compiled binaries, that should run on any x86_64 platform, with no
dependencies, are available in the following forms:

ftp://ftp.enjellic.com/pub/Quixote/Quixote-1.4-1.x86_64.rpm

ftp://ftp.enjellic.com/pub/Quixote/quixote_1.4-2_amd64.deb

The -1 and -2 differences are meaningless, we missed the -k argument
to alien.

The code will compile on Ubuntu 22.04 with GCC plus the Cortex R/M
ARM-GCC compiler.  The trust orchestrators will build with MUSL but
will probably require the presence of some MUSL compiled libraries.
