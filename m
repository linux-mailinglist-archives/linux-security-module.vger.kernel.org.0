Sounds good. I added a small remark "when updating this, also update
landlock_cred_copy() if needed".

Thanks, well spotted. This was indeed the intended behavior, the
new_capacity <= s->capacity check also makes much more sense that
way. (I have a more detailed answer in another reply.)  I fixed this
and also added an overflow check for good measure.

Thanks for spotting this, this is correct!  I added a NULL check.

Thank you, good catch!

The works.size check was inaccurate, because in the case of an error
during task_work_add(), it wasn't actually counting the number of
scheduled task works, but overestimating it.  The scenario is a bit
obscure, but initializing num_unfinished is a more robust approach
that rules out that variant of bugs.

Thanks, that is correct and I fixed it as you suggested. -- The thread
exiting is the only reason why task_work_add() can fail.  In the
(perfectly valid) case where one of the sibling threads happens to
exit, we do not want the landlock_restrict_self() syscall to fail just
because of that.

Thank you again for catching this!

I used your suggestion, with the following (minor) differences:

1. Factored it out as a function (indentation level got too high...)
2. typo: call complete_all() only if atomic_dec_return() returns 0
3. Do the same barrier synchronization dance with num_unfinished/all_finished as well.

...and I also implemented a selftest for the case where
landlock_restrict_self() gets called by two adjacent threads at the
same time.

I'll write down my reasoning why this works for reference:

The problem in V2 is that we can run into a deadlock in the case where
two thread call landlock_restrict_self().  In that case, they'll both
become uninterruptible at syscall entry and try to schedule a
task_work for each other.  Then, they proceed to wait for each other's
task_work to execute, which never happens because the task_work never
gets scheduled.

This is resolved by using an interruptible wait.  With the
interruptible wait, the task can detect the condition where a signal
(or task work) comes in, execute that task_work and bail out of the
system call cleanly (we un-schedule the task_works for other threads
that are still pending and we abort all the task_works that have
already started to run by setting the shared_ctx.preparation_error).
After returning from the system call with -ERESTARTNOINTR, it gets
retried automatically to recover from the problem.

In all the other cases where we wait_for_completion() uninterruptibly,
we can reason about that returning, because these happen under
circumstances where we know that the task works we are waiting for
have all been started already.

I have reproduced the deadlock and verified the fixed implementation
with the selftest, by temporarily adding mdelay() calls and a lot of
logging in strategic places.

Thanks, I fixed that one as well.
