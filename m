Thank you for the suggestion.

Small caveat is that the LSM interface is very central and we should
be careful.  We have previously gotten the advice from Paul to design
the hooks in an LSM-independent way that ideally reflects the
arguments to the unix_find_bsd() function, and this would now deviate
(slightly) from that, but simplifying the implementation for us.  In
my personal opinion, this might be worth doing the trade-off, if
AppArmor people also agree, but we should double check.

To keep the discussion of implementation and interface separate, I
have raised this question in the pathname-restricted-UNIX patch set
thread in [1].

Yes, you are describing the logic for the variant where
LANDLOCK_ACCESS_FS_RESOLVE_UNIX does not implicitly permit access from
within the same scope.  In that variant, there can be situations where
the first hook can deny the action immediately.

In the variant where LANDLOCK_ACCESS_FS_RESOLVE_UNIX *does* implicitly
allow access from within the same scope, that shortcutting is not
possible.  On the upside however, there is no need to distinguish
whether the scope flag is set when we are in the security_unix_find()
hook, because access from within the same scope is always permitted.
(That is the simplification I meant.)

Yes, it would be possible to use such a struct for that scenario where
IPC access gets allowed for other Landlock scopes.  It would mean that
we would not need to introduce a scoped flag for the pathname UNIX
socket connections.  But the relationship between that struct
landlock_scope_attr and the flags and access rights in struct
landlock_ruleset_attr would become less clear, which is a slight
downside, and maybe error prone for users to work with.

If we introduced an additional scoped flag, it would also be
consistent though.

(con1) was written under the assumption that we do not have an
additional scoped flag.  If that is lacking, it is not possible to
express UNIX connect() access to other Landlock domains with that
struct.  But as outlined in the proposal below, if we *do* (later)
introduce the additional scoped flag *in addition* to the FS access
right, this *both* stays consistent in semantics with the signal and
abstract UNIX support, *and* it starts working in a world where ICP
access can be allowed to talk to other Landlock domains.

Mickaël expressed the opinion to me that he would like to APIs to stay
consistent between signals, abstract UNIX sockets, named UNIX sockets
and other future "scoped" operations, in scenarios where:

* the "scoped" (IPC) operations can be configured to give access to
  other Landlock domains (and that should work for UNIX connections too)
* the existing "scoped" operations also start having matching access rights

I think with the way I proposed, that would be consistent.
