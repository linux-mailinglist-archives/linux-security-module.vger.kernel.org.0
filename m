I agree, there are a lot of different side channels in Linux.  Landlock
is about access control, like most LSMs, so this should not be an issue.
And if an LSM wants to hide this information, it can also return
-ECONNREFUSED or something else.

That's a good point, and it would give more informations to diagnose
issues.  However, being able to identify if both accesses are denied
would require to check both, whereas the first is enough to know that
Landlock denies the access.  So, if we can return both records without
continuing the security checks, that's good, otherwise we should stop
ASAP and return the error.

Anyway, that might not be needed if we end up with my latest proposal
about always setting scope.unix_socket when fs.resolve_unix is set.

This part might indeed be confusing.  The idea was to explain the
difference between scoped rights and handled access rights (which may
have rules).

The documentation will definitely require some updates.  I think it can
be explained in a simple way.

I see your point but I don't think it would be worth it to add
sub-scoped fields.  Each field has a clear semantic, and the scoped one
is related to the domain wrt other domains.

Yes, it would definitely be useful to add exception for other kind of
IPCs.  The idea would be to be able to describe the peer, either with a
file path, or PID, or cgroups, or a Landlock domain...  The inet case
is an interesting idea but that might be a challenging task to
implement, if even possible.
