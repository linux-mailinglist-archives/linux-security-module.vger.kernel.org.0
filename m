This is an artificial distinction that will prove limiting to the
security that Linux will be able to deliver in the future.
	
Based on your response, is it your stated position as Linux security
maintainer, that you consider modern Endpoint Detection and Response
Systems (EDRS) lacking with respect to their ability to implement a
"reasonable" enforcement and assurance mechanism?

If this is the case, your philosophy leaves Linux in a position that
is inconsistent with how the industry is choosing to implement
security.

Let me cite an example from one of our project advisors.

This individual is a senior principal at a reasonably large technology
products company that depends on Linux almost exclusively to support
its operations.  At any given instant he participates in supervising a
fleet of around 6,000 virtual machines running about 50,000-60,000
containerized workloads.

All of the Linux deployments are Ansible orchestrated.  The security
deployment consists of disabling SeLinux and installing an EDRS
solution.  Doing the latter checks all the boxes they need for their
corporate security compliance policies.

He, and others, have watched this discussion closely over the last two
years that we have tried to get TSEM reviewed and just recently phoned
me with the following comment:

"I think the problem is that these guys don't understand how security
is being done and the reasons why".

There is probably not a modern EDRS solution that does not involve
going to the cloud for its decision making enforcement, in most cases
based on Indicators Of Compromise (IOC) trained machine learning
models.  Asynchronous detection, enforcement and remediation is now
standard practice.  In the security industry, a 1 minute response to a
security event is considered the 'gold' standard.

For the sake of discussion, lets take a Quixote userspace Trusted
Modeling Agent (TMA) running TSEM based deterministic modeling of a
containerized workload.  As we've discussed previously, demonstrated
average response times are on the order of 170 micro-seconds.

For an event that needs asynchronous enforcement, ie. running in
atomic context, that represents a 3.5 order of magnitude advantage in
response over the industry standard, without the attendant challenges
of going off machine or installing kernel based infrastructure.

What would be the rationale or advantage of denying those that desire
this type of security option, a 3,500 fold increase in security
response times?

Let's take another need for running in userspace, trusted execution
environments.  Support is available in our userspace package for
running a TMA model in either an SGX enclave or in an independent
hypervisor protected execution context, both of which significantly
harden the enforcement implementation against attack by adversaries.

As Linux security maintainer, we assume that you have read Executive
Order 14144 signed on January 16th 2025.  That document specifically
calls out the requirement for the increased use of trusted execution
environments in combination with advancements in endpoint detection.

It shouldn't be a leap in imagination as to the regulatory compliance
advantages associated with hardware attestation that the security
implementation is operational and in a known good enforcement state.

Finally, at this point in time, it would seem unwise in the technology
industry, to discount the importance of 'AI', or more correctly
machine learning.  As we've noted before in our discussions, it is
unlikely that we are going to see synchronous LSM enforcement using a
machine learning model trained on potentially trillions of data
observations and indicators.

The LSM is designed to provide security services to the users of
Linux, not to be a kingdom.

Linux is/was about 'choice' as to how users want to use their
hardware.

Artifically limiting the types of security that can be implemented by
the LSM works to the detriment of the security innovation that Linux
can deliver and the Linux user community writ large.
