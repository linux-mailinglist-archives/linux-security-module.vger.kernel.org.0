If a setuid program execs itself, does the presence of this code undo
any protection the kernel afforded it on its first invocation? It
feels like changing that could easily turn out to be exploitable in
some context. Programs re-exec themselves all the time.

I suspect Serge is noting that s*id and f*uid are forced to be the
corresponding e*id later in the code (indeed you mention this feature
above where I've put [...]), so comparing the values before that takes
effect isn't really comparing the right values in your added code.

FWIW I ran the libcap quicktest.sh script against your change and it
doesn't break any capability thing I test for when making libcap
releases. That being said, in general this whole zoo of *[ug]id values
and their subtle behavior is not casually obvious. I'd recommend using
a userspace workaround for your use case, and not changing the legacy
behavior of the kernel.

Cheers

Andrew
