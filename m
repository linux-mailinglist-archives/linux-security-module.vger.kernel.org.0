Thanks a lot Stefan for looking into this proposal,
and providing your feedback. We really appreciate it.

You are correct that truncation on it’s own is dangerous. It needs to be
accompanied by (a) saving the IMA log data to disk as snapshots, (b) 
adding the
necessary TPM PCR quotes to the current IMA log (as James mentioned above),
(c) attestation clients having an ability to send the past snapshots to the
remote-attestation-service (verifiers), (d) and verifiers having an ability
to use the snapshots along with current IMA logs for the purpose of 
attestation.
All these points are explained in the original RFC email in sections B.1 
through B.5 [1].

  Agreed. See the description of snapshot_aggregate in Section B.5 in the
original RFC email [1].

Yes, the PCR quotes sent to the verifier must be signed by the AK that
is trusted by the verifier. That assumption is true regardless of IMA log
snapshotting feature.

If the Kernel is compromised, then all-bets are off.

Yes. If the “PCR quotes in the snapshot_aggregate event in IMA log”
+ "replay of rest of the events in IMA log" results in the “final PCR 
quotes”
that matches with the “AK signed PCR quotes” sent by the client, then 
the truncated
IMA log can be trusted. The verifier can either ‘trust’ the “PCR quotes 
in the
snapshot_aggregate event in IMA log” or it can ask for the (n-1)th 
snapshot shard
to check the past events.

Assuming most of the client devices take a snapshot at specific checkpoints,
the “PCR quotes in the snapshot_aggregate event in IMA log” will be the 
same for them.
The remote attestation server will have to remember these golden PCR quotes.
It doesn't have to remember the state of each client device.

Yes, restarting the client should be possible.

The server is not forced to remember the state of IMA PCRs. It can
always ask for the last n snapshot files (shards) and replay the events. 
Even
though the data is truncated from the IMA log, it is not totally lost. It is
simply being transferred to the disk. It is saved by UM as snapshot 
files/shards.
The goal of IMA snapshotting is to reduce the Kernel memory pressure on the
client devices - to save them from out-of-memory errors which are harder 
to manage
on long running clients. It comes with a cost of additional work on the 
server
side to attest those clients.


Being said that, in the current proposal, taking a snapshots is totally 
optional
and controlled by UM attestation clients. If the 
attestation-clients/services are
not-ready/don’t-want to take advantage of IMA log snapshotting, they 
don’t have to.

No snapshot will be taken, and the client-service can process the 
monolithic IMA
log just like they do today.
