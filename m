Arguably, when a Linux distro that is enabling new features, e.g.
multiple LSMs and/or the BPF LSM, they have an obligation to migrate
away from legacy/deprecated configuration knobs to properly use those
new features.

With the "security=3D" command line option only supporting one LSM, it's
going to be hard to do the right thing in all situations; someone is
always going to be upset with the placement in a multi-LSM system.
Perhaps it's time to make a push to properly deprecate and eventually
remove the "security=3D" command line option; it would definitely
simplify the kernel code.

https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/admin-guide/kernel-parameters.html

I'll agree that the documentation probably should carry a stronger
warning, but it is marked as deprecated.

That would be a decision the BPF LSM maintainer would need to make.
There is precedent for doing things like this in the BPF LSM, and I
would tend to agree that this hook probably has little use for the
usual BPF LSMs.

This is a legacy carryover from the early days of the LSM framework
and SELinux.  By the time there was a need for LSM specific entries in
procfs there was already a significant amount of userspace that relied
on getting SELinux info from /proc/*/attr; migrating to
/proc/*/attr/selinux (or any other path for that matter) would have
broken too many things.

The good news is that there are a number of reasons why we want to get
away from using procfs for these things anyway, and we recently added
a few LSM syscalls to both solve the procfs problems and better
support multiple LSMs.  LWN.net wrote a nice article on the syscalls
which you can find at the link below:
