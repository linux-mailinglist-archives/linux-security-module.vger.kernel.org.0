Looking at the documentation [1] it is stated that

"Encrypted keys do not depend on a TPM, and are faster, as they use AES
for encryption/decryption."

Why would you need to remove support for encrypted keys? Isn't it a
regression in encrypted keys to hard depend on trusted keys given
what the documentation says?

There is nothing to disagree or agree. I just try to get the picture
since ecryptfs is relatively alien to me.
