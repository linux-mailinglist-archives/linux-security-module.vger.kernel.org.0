Yes, but my point is that it's often at the wrong point in time. You
can mediate this earlier as well - see my open_tree() comment below.

If you want to start doing full mediation for the new mount api you're
likely missing quite a few pieces. 

I expect you need a hook in at least fsmount() as this always creates a
detached mount for a new filesystem context (You touched on that in an
earlier mail.).

But you also need a new hook in open_tree() but _only_ in the
OPEN_TREE_CLONE path because that creates detached mounts as well.

And you will also very likely want a new hook in mount_setattr() because
that allows you to change mount properties as well and the creation of
idmapped mounts and so on.
