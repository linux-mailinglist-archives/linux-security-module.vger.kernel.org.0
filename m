I think there is misunderstanding with FIPS.

Having FIPS certificated RNG in TPM matters but it only matters only in 
the sense that callers can be FIPS certified as they use that RNG as a 
source.

Using FIPS certified RNG does not magically make callers be FIPS 
ceritified actors. The data is contaminated in that sense at the point
when kernel acquires it.
