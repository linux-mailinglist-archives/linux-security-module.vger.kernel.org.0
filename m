I was naming it ima-buffer, but naming is not a huge concern.
I will use linux,ima-kexec-buffer.

The approach i have in this patch set is to provide an abstraction layer 
that can be called from any architecture.
However taking a deeper look only the setup dtb is probably architecture
specific, only because the architecture specific kexec sets up the 
device tree. I can also move the code up in security/ima. However i do
have some concerns with layering. I am hoping you can provide me with 
some guidance in this aspect, i will send you the patch i am working on
to get some early feedback.
