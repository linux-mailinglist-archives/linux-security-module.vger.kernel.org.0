For whatever it is worth, as a group, we invested a considerable
amount of time, over a period of now 8+ years, in refining the
terminology and nomenclature embodied in that document.

I guess the only defense at hand is a variant on the alleged response
by Austrian Emperor Joseph II to Mozart's "Die Entfuhrung aus dem
Serail":

"It contains as many words, with appropriate ornateness, as was deemed
necessary."

I believe the case can be made that Quixote/TSEM approaches the
challenge of security from a significantly different conceptual basis
than a significant body of current art in the field.

Legend has it that Dyson and Feynman spent two years talking before
they were able to conclude that they were understanding one another,
despite the fact they were working toward a common goal.

We respect any time you can afford to this.

With respect to the notion of getting others to play with a new
technology concept.

Security, from an innovation perspective, is an interesting challenge,
probably a candidate for a book with my long time trusted consigliere.
Who, at the risk of excessive ornateness, would delve deeply into the
notion of how structural inherencies act to preclude innovation.

Thanks for the update, best wishes for a productive remainder of the
week.
