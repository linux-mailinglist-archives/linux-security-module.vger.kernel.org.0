While I do think being able to control UNIX socket access via domain
scoping is useful (after all, it is an additional bit of information /
relationship that "normal" filesystem objects doesn't have, and
applications using Landlock might find it useful to control access based
on this extra information, either to simplify the policy, or because a
generic sandboxer can't come up with a pre-determined list of UNIX socket
fs rules, e.g. for applications which places socket in hard-coded "/tmp"),
I do share the worry about how this might get confusing from an API
perspective, as discussed in my GitHub comment [1].

Another way to put it is that, if FS-based and scope-based controls
interacts in the above proposed way, both mechanisms feel like "poking
holes" in the other.  But as Mickaël said, one can think of the two
mechanisms not as independent controls, but rather as two interfaces for
the same control.  The socket access control is "enabled" if either the
LANDLOCK_ACCESS_FS_RESOLVE_UNIX access is handled, or the scope bit
proposed in this patch is enabled.

With that said, I can think of some alternative ways that might make this
API look "better" (from a subjective point of view, feedback welcome),
however it does mean more delays, and specifically, these will depend on
LANDLOCK_ACCESS_FS_RESOLVE_UNIX:

One possibility is to simply always allow a Landlock domain to connect to
its own sockets (in the case where LANDLOCK_ACCESS_FS_RESOLVE_UNIX is
handled, otherwise all sockets are allowed).  This might be reasonable, as
one can only connect to a socket it creates if it has the permission to
create it in the first place, which is already controlled by
LANDLOCK_ACCESS_FS_MAKE_SOCK, so we don't really lose any policy
flexibility here - if for some reason the sandboxer don't want to allow
access to any (pathname) sockets, even the sandboxed app's own ones, it
can just not allow LANDLOCK_ACCESS_FS_MAKE_SOCK anywhere.

Another possibility is to have this scope control as part of the
LANDLOCK_ACCESS_FS_RESOLVE_UNIX rule itself, rather than as a separate
scope bit, via introducing a "rule flag" (which is a new mechanism
proposed in [2]) which I will tentatively call
(LANDLOCK_ADD_RULE_)SAME_SCOPE_ONLY.  So for example:

- If the sandboxer wants to allow all socket access, don't handle
  LANDLOCK_ACCESS_FS_RESOLVE_UNIX at all, or handle it but have an allow
  rule at / with no flags.

- If it wants to allow access to only the sandboxed app's own sockets,
  handle LANDLOCK_ACCESS_FS_RESOLVE_UNIX, then place one allow rule on /
  with the rule flag SAME_SCOPE_ONLY.  This means that the allow rule
  "UNIX socket under /" only allows connecting to sockets in the same
  domain scope.  Additional rules without this rule flag can be placed on
  more specific places to add "exceptions" to allow access to more
  privileged sockets.

- To allow access to specific sockets only, not even the sandboxed app's
  own sockets, just use LANDLOCK_ACCESS_FS_RESOLVE_UNIX without this new
  rule flag.

This is slightly more flexible than just the LANDLOCK_SCOPE_PATHNAME_UNIX_SOCKET
scope bit plus LANDLOCK_ACCESS_FS_RESOLVE_UNIX, as it allows the sandboxer
to specify where an application can connect, even with sockets in its own
domain, and it also nicely avoids the "what feels like two independent
controls poking holes in each other" problem.  But it does mean more
complexity (although hopefully not too much), as we now need to introduce
the rule flags concept, but that is required for some other proposed stuff
anyway - quiet flags [3] and no_inherit [4] rules, and the rule flags
design is in a good state I think.

What do folks think?

(btw, when I say "sandboxed app" this can of course also mean multiple
applications in the same sandbox, e.g. like a container runtime as Mickaël
pointed out, which raises the probability that just having
LANDLOCK_ACCESS_FS_RESOLVE_UNIX would be insufficient, e.g. when bind
mounts are involved, or other cases which I haven't thought of right now)
