Ok, there are examples of both passing a file descriptor and passing a
pathname from userspace, but even in the case of passing a pathname,
userspace normally creates the file.

There's been discussion in the past of defining an integrity
capability.  Are we at that point where we really do need to define an
integrity capability or is everyone comfortable with relying on
CAP_SYS_ADMIN?

When implementing this feature of exporting and truncating the
measurement list, please keep in mind how this would work in the
context of IMA namespaces.

thanks,

Mimi
