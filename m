Yap, much better, thanks!

And that whole deal with the providing the secret this way is because
you want to be starting the same guest image in the cloud over and over
again but each guest owner would have their own decryption key which
they would supply this way.

Yap, good.

Which begs the question: why are you even doing this for only SEV
instead of supporting SEV-SNP/TDX only?

I'm under the impression that people should run only SNP and the
equivalent of that in TDX, guests but not those earlier technologies
which are lacking in some situations.

Which reminds me - I still need to take a look at that one.

I'm gravitating towards a common API so that userspace doesn't have to
care. But that comes at the price of having to define that API properly
so that it fits them all. And we all know how that bikeshedding works.

That's what Joerg and me came up with - "coco" :-)

That's not bad too.

Thx.
