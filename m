OK, what about these new paragraphs replacing the second one?

This led to an inconsistent backward compatibility behavior which was
only taken into account if no domain layer were using the new
LANDLOCK_ACCESS_FS_REFER right. However, when restricting a thread with 
a new ruleset handling LANDLOCK_ACCESS_FS_REFER, all inherited parent 
ruleset/layers not explicitly handling LANDLOCK_ACCESS_FS_REFER would 
behave as if they were handling this access right and with all their 
rules allowing it. This means that renaming and linking files could 
became allowed by these parent layers, but all the other required 
accesses must also be granted: all layers must allow file removal or 
creation, and renaming and linking operations must not lead to privilege 
escalation according to the Landlock policy (see detailed explanation in 
commit b91c3e4ea756).

To say it another way, this bug may lifts the renaming and linking 
limitations of the initial Landlock version, and a same ruleset can 
restrict differently depending on previous or next enforced ruleset 
(i.e. inconsistent behavior). The LANDLOCK_ACCESS_FS_REFER right cannot 
give access to data not already allowed, but this doesn't follow the 
contract of the first Landlock ABI. This fix puts back the limitation 
for sandboxes that didn't opt-in for this additional right.

For instance, if a first ruleset allows LANDLOCK_ACCESS_FS_MAKE_REG on 
/dst and LANDLOCK_ACCESS_FS_REMOVE_FILE on /src, renaming /src/file to 
/dst/file is denied. However, without this fix, stacking a new ruleset 
which allows LANDLOCK_ACCESS_FS_REFER on / would now permit the 
sandboxed thread to rename /src/file to /dst/file .
