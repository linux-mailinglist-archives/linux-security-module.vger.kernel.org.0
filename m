Good job for writing this complex mechanic (and the related doc), this
patch series is great!  It's been in linux-next for a few weeks and I'll
take it for Linux 7.0

I did some cosmetic changes though, you'll find them in my commits.
Some more tests are needed but I'll take this series for now.

Thanks!
