I'll agree that I could probably phrase the paragraph above s little
better, but I disagree with the assertion that the paragraph implies
"LSMs are always developed for corporate use".

How about the following:

"The new LSM's author(s) must commit to maintain and support the new LSM fo=
r
an extended period of time; this applies both to authors that are employed =
to
develop and maintain a LSM as well as those that develop and maintain a LSM=
 on
their own time.  If the authors are currently supporting a LSM as part of t=
heir
employment, there is an expectation upstream that support will continue bey=
ond
the authors' tenure at their current company.  In either case, if the autho=
rs
are unable to commit to supporting the LSM for an extended period of time, =
a
reasonable succession plan must be submitted along with the LSM."
