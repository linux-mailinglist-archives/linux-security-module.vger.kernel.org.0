It seems pretty clear, to us anyway, that generic user expectations
are that advanced security controls for Linux, ie beyond DAC, should
provide the same compartmentalization and isolation that other
resource namespaces bring to the table.  The 10 years of experience we
have had with building systems, and feedback we have received from
collaborators with significant experience in critical infrastructure,
drove the focus in TSEM on strictly partitioned and workload based
security controls.

We obviously had an advantage in that we came into this with the
opportunity for a clean design, whereas the existing, particularly
label based solutions, have the constraint of a single ground truth
with respect to the inode label implemented in the extended
attributes.  Which is the fault of nobody, but rather a function of
the fact that label based systems have a heritage from before anyone
even thought about resource namespaces.

Do to our objectives, and the approach we took, TSEM doesn't require
support for 'stacking' with other LSM's, obviously other LSM's do need
that support, not a criticism but an observation.  That opened the
door to implement what users would consider to be an independent
security namespace.

The take away, that I assume everyone interested in Linux security
would be in agreement on, perhaps not, is that user expectations are
to have independent and separately administered security control
environments that don't interact with one another.

I believe TSEM demonstrates that we already have the infrastructure at
the LSM layer for generic namespacing.  Of all the current LSM's, I
believe we have the most sophisticated namespace implementation with
respect to the functionality that it implements.

We have implemented TSEM using both the standard Linux namespace
infrastructure and as an independent namespace implementation using
the LSM 'blob' infrastructure.  FWIW, we have never looked back on the
decision to implement LSM specific namespacing using the generic LSM
'blob' functionality.

If there is a desire to provide some minimum level of generic security
namespace functionality I could recitate a whole list of thoughts to
consider but will leave that to another time.

These reflections illuminate our motivation in developing TSEM, others
may disagree, but a lot of experience in, and observation of, the
security industry has led us to believe that security has to get
simpler and easier to implement rather than more complex and arcane.

We are probably at an interesting juncture in Linux development.  The
security controls we make available as a platform can either pursue a
path where only highly skilled administrators and technology companies
can implement them, or, we can provide mechanisms that work to increase
the accessibility by development teams and ultimately the user
community to advanced security controls.

With TSEM, our design philosophy is that security controls need to
flow from the development process in order to accomplish this latter
objective.  CI/CD is now considered a necessary and standard practice
in the software industry, it doesn't seem like a stretch of the
imagination that security controls should flow from that process as
well.

One of the requirements of this model is the ability to strictly scope
security controls to the level of a workload nee security modeling
namespace.

Regardless of motivation, it would seem from this thread alone, that
there is a user expectation, if not a necessary technical requirement,
for Linux to provide infrastructure that enables strictly partitioned
and independent security controls that don't require extensive
reasoning as to what they might actually do in practice.

Have a good week.
