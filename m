Personally I don't think making the list of handled accesses mutable would
add a lot of value (after all, a sandbox would usually handle all accesses
that it knows of), and I would like to avoid the complexity of making the
list of handled accesses mutable.  The semantic of "intersection" and
"union" of handled accesses is also not trivial: if ruleset A handles
read, and ruleset B handles read+write, their "intersection", if
interpreted as "only allow accesses allowed by both rulesets", would in
fact handle read+write (and their "union" would handle read only).

In the second (union) case, there is also the problem of what to do if
ruleset B has write access rules - these rules would technically become
invalid (although to no negative effect) in a ruleset that doesn't handle
write.

I do see the benefit of modifying scope bits (and maybe also
quiet_access_* bits), but I'm still worried about the extra complexity
(and thus also testing / docs needed etc)

If we do keep with the "intersect" way of removing rules (instead of
replace / clear all), this does seem like an interesting idea.  However,
it is more complex to implement (it will probably require traversing two
rbtrees at once to be implemented efficiently), and I'm not sure how much
utility this would add compared to just LANDLOCK_ADD_RULE_INTERSECT.  See
below for more reasoning.

Using a dedicated ioctl to commit is also a potentially better idea - I
find that having the commit be a side effect of landlock_add_rule() via a
flag a bit unwieldy, as it would either require the supervisor to track
when it adds the last rule, or to add an "empty" rule just to commit.

Mickaël, you initially suggested the LANDLOCK_ADD_RULE_COMMIT_SUPERVISOR
flag, but do you think this is better?

In this case, wouldn't we also be removing rules via landlock_add_rule()?
Personally I feel like this inconsistency is tolerable (it's easy enough
to explain), but I guess we could also change this to an ioctl if this is
a problem.

If a supervisor doesn't care about potential renames / mount / namespace
changes making the sandboxed application lose access to previously
accessible files, the "clear all rules" approach would not force it to
keep any fds open in order to remove rules (i.e. it can clear everything,
then re-open the fds to add the rules back).  On the other hand, with the
"intersect" approach, it would have to keep the fds open in all cases to
correctly remove previously added rules, so I think this "clear all" is
not more cumbersome.

There is a general consideration here about how much we want to design the
API to advantage / disadvantage particular ways of using it.  For example,
having ruleset-ruleset intersection / union operations would (in theory,
setting aside the fact that to remain compatible to older kernels it
cannot do this for constructions of existing static rulesets) work very
well for something like island [1] / landlock-config, where we compose
rulesets by intersecting / unioning different landlock configuration files
together.  However, it will introduce more complexity to someone who just
wants to allow access as they come up (e.g. something like a "permissive /
learning mode"), as they now have to, every time when an access is denied,
create a new ruleset, add one single rule, and do a union.

IMO, there is also the general preference of having complicated logic
being in user-space rather than implemented by the kernel.  In this case,
one can argue that for someone that wants to compose rulesets via logical
operations, this should really be handled by a Landlock library, which
could, for static rulesets, do it completely internally in-memory, and do
one landlock_create_ruleset() + n landlock_add_rule()s in the end.  For
live modifications, it could then use the more low-level "intersect" /
"add rule" / "clear all" uAPI.  Compared to intersecting single rules,
having the kernel do the logical operations on entire rulesets also
doesn't reduce the number of syscalls needed (you still need one
landlock_add_rule() for each rule to be modified), so there is not a
performance argument either

(although for the use case where the supervisor wants to incrementally add
and remove rules, there is a performance benefit to intersect vs "clear
all".  But I do wonder how often in practice this would be implemented for
a supervisor that can remove rules - because it needs to keep an in-memory
table for the fds it has open anyway, in order to correctly remove rules,
a simpler approach would be to simply clear all, then re-add whatever it
wants based on what it still has in that table).
