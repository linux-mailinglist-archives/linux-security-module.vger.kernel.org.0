Interesting outlook.

FWIW, on a strictly unrelated, non-technical front.

My Dad is telling me the same thing, almost every day, about these
automatic transmissions they are putting in cars.  I'm hoping that
what he thinks comes true before I have lost all the acumen that I
developed double-clutching a 3-5-5 triple split Fuller LoadRanger on
the tail of the 3208 Cat that I spent a fair amount of time driving,
during a decidedly non-technical interlude in my professional career.

The above offered, as a public service to any interests, who feel that
TSEM shouldn't see the light of day because it, proudly,
originates from what are decidedly hillbilly origins... :-)

Besides security, it looks like I also personally fail, on a secondary
technical front.  I architected, designed and direct the maintenance
over a pretty good sized SAN, that has been steadily advancing over
the last 23 years since it was first built.  It currently links three
geographically dispersed data-centers at 32 GBPS storage target speeds
to synchronously replicate petabytes of data on a day in and data out
basis.  Not sure how we would do all of that without the concept of a
storage network.

I guess time will tell on all of these fads.

All I can speak for are the groups that we are engaged with who
indicate that they believe that workload specific security controls
are a reasonable, if not necessary requirement, for how software
development is evolving, and who have an interest in seeing what TSEM
represents available on Linux.

Our conversations in this forum would suggest you believe such ideas
are completely misguided.  From your perspective and experiences, that
may not be an unreasonable on systems that are supporting adversarial
parties.

This is security, so no one wants to talk about who may be doing
something and how.  FWIW, the people who contemplate this as a useful
advancement represent a formidable body of experience in the security
industry.

I did 107 miles of cycling yesterday, in the glacial moraine lake
country of West-Central Minnesota, trying to parse what the above
means.

The best that I can come up with is that only systems administrators,
or perhaps security personnel, should understand what security
controls are implemented and how.

All the environments we have experience with suggest that everyone is
on the same team; platform engineers, administrators, developers,
security personnel, quality assurance et.al.  They are all focused on
having a solution be as secure as possible.

Some have watched these conversations and don't understand why it
would be unreasonable for a development team to be able to implement
controls that could catch a possible defect in their application
stack, before system wide controls would need to stop the behavior.

You misinterpret my point, let me see if I can clarify.

The LSM, over the course of its development, has developed a
significant body of security inspection points, at the expense of a
fair amount of pain as Paul Moore would seem to suggest, for what has
been determined to be security significant actions, all to support the
needs of various security enforcement systems.

It may not represent all relevant security behavior, but it is the sum
of what is available for Linux as a platform, you cannot get any
better visibility, without adding more hooks, which seems to be
increasingly problematic and conflict laden.

So TSEM comes at this from the perspective of: "If life gives you
lemons, make lemonade".

We take all of the available information that these interception
points can generate and use it to enable the application of
mathematical models that range through the spectrum of deterministic,
quasi-deterministic, and with an increasing relevance, machine
learning models.

All of this provides a pathway to security model resolution that
represents a detection and interdiction strength that equals the sum
of what all the other LSM security schemes can produce, put together.

If additional hooks get added and they make sense from a modeling
perspective, any security models implemented via TSEM will
gain additional resolution.

Presumably a security token bearing scheme, we will look forward to
seeing it.

Again, with reference to the discussion above, it is the best that
Linux can do as a platform.  If TSEM's security model cannot detect an
aberration, by definition, there would be no reason to expect that any
of the other LSM based security controls could detect and act on the
threat.

A final point.

TSEM models are exquisitely sensitive to deviations in the security
behavior of a workload.  You would presumably have little interest in
taking the time to actually test TSEM with the Quixote utilities but
doing so may be illuminating for you or others within the Linux
security community.

The contributing factor to this high sensitivity is the security state
coefficient generation function that is used.  The 'Event Modeling'
section of the TSEM document, starting at line 704, goes into some
detail on this aspect of the security model.

From a big picture perspective, every corpus of executable code will
have its own representation of any of the security behaviors that the
LSM is capable of tracking.  The TSEM documentation has practical
examples of how this manifests itself in practice.

Once gain, nothing about TSEM involves the user community, unless of
course, the user community means the development teams that are
putting the application stacks on the platform.

TSEM is designed to provide a mechanism for machine learning to have
access to what by definition, is all of the relevant security behavior
information that Linux has available to it as a platform.  The primary
user community will be data science teams.

I wouldn't have a clue as to what they are looking for, you would need
to ask the CrowdStrike security engineering teams.

Given how closely guarded security technology is, with machine
learning models considered the most closely guarded secrets there are,
it seems unlikely they would tell you.

Their current 35.11 billion dollar valuation is dependent on their
ability to detect anomalous platform security behavior, however they
do it, if you believe their web-site, it is through event modeling and
artifical intelligence schemes implemented in the 'cloud'.  I suspect
you would need to run a request up through your chain of command to
Pat Gelsinger to try and get access to exactly what they are doing.

Pat Gelsinger taking George Kurtz to lunch, or some similar momentous
exchange, is where those types of deals for exchange of cooperation
probably need to get done.

You had suggested in a previous e-mail that there are software
'snake-oil' salesman out there, maybe that is what CrowdStrike
represents, if so they are making a ton of money doing it.

You would probably disagree, but TSEM is about an easier way of doing
things.

Yes, the perils of transitive security reasoning.

TSEM isn't about that, TSEM is more about the security model that
every firewall running on the planet implements.

It is all, actually, pretty straight forward.

Assume a deterministic or quasi-deterministic model (model inputs run
through a leveling algorithm).

There exists a finite field of security coefficients that will be
generated for a workload based on the security coefficient generation
algorithm in use.  By default, all coefficients in the field will deny
access to their associated event.  Unit testing of the workload
generates a sub-field of coefficients whose associated actions are
permitted.

This allows development teams to place a bounding set on the allowed
security behavior of their workload.  If you don't trust your
developers to do complete CI/CD coverage you install additional
controls as a secondary security boundary.

There are always exceptions, but our experience is that development
teams are starting to get pretty serious about the security of their
stacks and their CI/CD code coverage.

From our perspective, it doesn't seem right-headed for Linux to deny
them access to the ability to leverage mandatory control schemes to
improve their deliverable.

Indeed and we have probably hit the asymptotic limit of interest to
anyone who may be following along at home.
