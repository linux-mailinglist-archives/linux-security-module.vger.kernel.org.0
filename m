What is the security benefit of having the key blob creation in user-space
instead of in the kernel? Key import is a standard operation in HSMs or PKCS#11
tokens.

I mainly see the downside of having to add another API to access the underlying
functionality (be it trusted key TA or the NXP CAAM HW *) and requiring
platform-specific userspace code.

This CAAM specific API (in out-of-tree patches) was exactly the part I was
trying to get rid of. ;)

Jan
