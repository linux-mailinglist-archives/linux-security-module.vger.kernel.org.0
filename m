This ID reservation process is very much a problem for you all.

In https://lkml.kernel.org/r/CAHC9VhQGnEcoYeGpwbbXbMrG1dOvJ=2ohd4zPYoqBJK9p1mSjQ@mail.gmail.com ,
Paul said that it is becoming increasingly difficult for people to find time to
review potential new LSMs.

Actually, previous CaitSith proposal in 2016 at
https://lkml.kernel.org/r/1477054150-4772-1-git-send-email-penguin-kernel@I-love.SAKURA.ne.jp
died because nobody except John Johansen showed interest, and John could not
find time to review.

We are getting more and more difficult to get new LSM module in-tree.
An in-development code being remaining out-of-tree shall happen. And you are
declaring that we ignore LSM modules which cannot get enough interests.
That's horrible and unacceptable.

What I'm repeating since
https://lkml.kernel.org/r/2225aec6-f0f3-d38e-ee3c-6139a7c25a37@I-love.SAKURA.ne.jp is that

  You are making LSM interface more and more unattractive. The consequence would be
  "The LSM interface is dead. We will give up implementing as LSMs."

Quite simple.
