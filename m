This LSM was born out of a motivation to provide strong integrity 
guarantees without a dependency on file-metadata, allow the integrity 
claims to be configurable on a hot system, and allow for the mechanisms 
for ensuring integrity to be extendable.

This naturally had to be an LSM, as controlling execution at the block 
or filesystem layer does not make sense. Existing LSM implementations 
use filesystem metadata, and since one of IPE's goals is to secure file 
metadata, it is circular to depend on the file metadata itself to make 
decisions about whether the file has been modified.

Additionally, IPE while IPE currently provides dm-verity support and the 
trust root support, it can be easily extended to other implementations 
such as fs-verity. At it's core, IPE is attempting to separate mechanism 
(dm-verity, fs-verity, etc.) from policy (IPE).

Thanks! I'll move the changelog.
