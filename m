It's not clear to me that you've done a close review of the verity related
patches, including not just this one but the dm-verity related ones and the
fsverity and dm-verity support in IPE itself, given the issues that I've been
finding in them in the last couple months.  As I said before, I'm not too
enthusiastic about IPE myself, for various reasons I've explained, so I've
really been looking to the people who actually want it to help drive it forward.

Anyway, as I also said, the fsverity and dm-verity support does seem to be
improved now after all the rounds of feedback, and I think it's close to the
finish line.  I just hope you can understand that I'm also a bit burnt out now,
and getting asked for an ack on this patch again and then seeing a bug in it
(despite it having been simplified to only a few lines now) and also still
misleading information in the commit message that I asked to be fixed before, is
a bit frustrating.  I think it's reasonable to expect a bit better, especially
for a security oriented feature.

Thanks,

- Eric
