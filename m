I could've sworn this was discussed on the SGX list at one point, but
apparently we only discussed it internally.  Anyways...

More than likely, the READ_IMPLIES_EXECUTE (RIE) crud rears its head
because part of the enclave loader is written in assembly.  Unless
explicitly told otherwise, the linker assumes that any program with
assembly code may need an executable stack, which leads to the RIE
personality being set for the process.  Here's a fantastic write up for
more details: https://www.airs.com/blog/archives/518

There are essentially two paths we can take:

 1) Exempt EPC pages from RIE during mmap()/mprotect(), i.e. don't add
    PROT_EXEC for enclaves.

 2) Punt the issue to userspace.

Option (1) is desirable in some ways:

  - Enclaves will get an executable stack if and only if the loader/creator
    intentionally configures it to have an executable stack.

  - Separates enclaves from the personality of the loader.

  - Userspace doesn't have to do anything for the common case of not
    wanting an executable stack for its enclaves.

The big down side to (1) is that it'd require an ugly hook in architecture
agnostic code.  And arguably, it reduces the overall security of the
platform (more below).

For (2), userspace has a few options:

 a) Tell the linker the enclave loader doesn't need RIE, either via a .note
    in assembly files or via the global "-z noexecstack" flag.

 b) Spawn a separate process to run/map the enclave if the enclave loader
    needs RIE.

 c) Require enclaves to allow PROT_EXEC on all pages.  Note, this is an
    absolutely terrible idea and only included for completeness.

As shown by the lack of a mmap()/mprotect() hook in this series to squash
RIE, we chose option (2).  Given that enclave loaders are not legacy code
and hopefully following decent coding practices, option (2a) should suffice
for all loaders.  The security benefit mentioned above is that forcing
enclave loaders to squash RIE eliminates an exectuable stack as an attack
vector on the loader.

If for some reason a loader "needs" an executable stack, requiring such a
beast to jump through a few hoops to run sane enclaves doesn't seem too
onerous.

This obviously needs to be called out in the kernel docs.
