Yes, that was the point..

Interesting. I'm not a X86 man, but it looks like a SMAP trap to me.
In other words, the kernel was not allowed to read that
"/var/log/ima.log" string as SMAP protection was active for that piece
of memory. I was under the impression that the SMAP is disabled while
the copy_from_user is running..

I'll try on the X86 hardware and see if I can reproduce, maybe its off
by one read or something. Only X86 target I tested was QEMU.

That's why the file name was left as an argument to the export
function; you can export either one. I suppose we'd need some setting
to tell it which one to export.
