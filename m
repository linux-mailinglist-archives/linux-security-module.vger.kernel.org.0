No, this is not only a distro issue but also an upstream issue!
Because the upstream cannot afford accepting whatever proposed LSMs
( https://lkml.kernel.org/r/8ac2731c-a1db-df7b-3690-dac2b371e431@I-love.SAKURA.ne.jp ).
That is, out-of-tree LSMs cannot become in-tree and obtain stable LSM ID is
partially due to upstream (e.g. out of resources for review, or failure to
pass patent examination because upstream does not think it adds a new value).
Making out-of-tree (or in-tree but not built-in) LSMs harder to use is a
penalty imposed by "Permanent members are exercising veto".
At least, assigning stable LSM ID to whatever proposed LSM has absolutely
zero cost. Current policy is a clear intention to lock out out-of-tree LSMs.
If you say "I don't have intention to lock out out-of-tree LSMs", please
don't go with just NACK added.
