From a kernel perspective, it doesn't make a difference if userspace
provides a tmpfs or persistent file.  As per the discussion 
https://lore.kernel.org/linux-integrity/CAOQ4uxj4Pv2Wr1wgvBCDR-tnA5dsZT3rvdDzKgAH1aEV_-r9Qg@mail.gmail.com/#t
, userspace provides the kernel with the file descriptor of the opened
file.

If no file descriptor is provided, then the measurements aren't copied
and removed from the securityfs file.  If there are write errors, the
measurements aren't removed from the securityfs file until the write
errors are resolved.
