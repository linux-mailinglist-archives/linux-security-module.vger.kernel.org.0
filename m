That would imply that the delimiter you would choose for the
multiplexed approach would be something odd (I think you suggested
0x02, or similar, earlier) which would likely require the multiplexed
subj field to become a hex encoded field which would be very
unfortunate in my opinion and would technically break with the current
subj/obj field format spec.  Picking a normal-ish delimiter, and
restricting its use by LSMs seems wrong to me.

It's also worth noting that if you were to move subj/obj to hex
encoded fields, in addition to causing a backwards compatibility
problem, you completely kill the ability to look at the raw log data
and make sense of the fields ... well, unless you can do the ascii hex
conversion in your head on the fly.

Then you should already realize why this is a terrible idea ;)

Today when you go to search through your audit log you know that a
single LSM is providing subj labels, and you also know which LSM that
happens to be, so searching on a given string, or substring, is easy
and generally safe.  In a multiplexed approach this becomes much more
difficult, and depending on the search being done it could be
misleading, perhaps even dangerous with complicated searches that
exclude label substrings.

It's important to remember that Steve's strstr() comment only reflects
his set of userspace tools.  When you start talking about log
aggregation and analytics, it seems very likely that there are other
tools in use, likely with their own parsers that do much more
complicated searches than a simple strstr() call.

If you can't pick a "safe" delimiter that isn't included in any of the
LSM label formats, how else do you know how to parse the multiplexed
mess?

No, you can't.  You still need to parse the multiplexed mess, that's
the problem.
