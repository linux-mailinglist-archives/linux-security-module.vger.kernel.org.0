First, to be very clear, we are not asking for any kind of
intervention or arbitration on your part.

Second and most importantly.  You've been belly-aching about this
problem for as long as I can remember and you I go back to 1992
together with Linux.

You, and only you, can fix the problem if you want it fixed.  Issue an
immediate statement that you will no longer accept any code that
implements an 'LSM'.

That will drive security development out of the kernel, which is where
it is going to go eventually anyway OR it will drive the security
community to try and fix what it considers to be the challenges with
eBPF when it comes to building security solutions.

Somewhat paradoxically in all of this, TSEM isn't even an LSM that
implements security policy.  It is generic infrastructure that was
built to address the very problem you are bitching about.

If Linux is really about technology, as you have continually
advocated, then there has to be an open playing field for
contributors.  Absent that, Linux will balkanize, the same way the
commercial Unix implementations did, around corporate driven
interests and motivations.

We will pursue the open playing field issue through the TAB if
necessary.

Once again, with all due respect, fix the problem if it annoys you,
you would be doing a lot of people a favor.

Best wishes for a pleasant holiday season to you and your family.

As always,
