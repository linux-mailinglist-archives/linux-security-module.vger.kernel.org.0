Agreed.  This isn't an abstract problem, but one that has already come
up and, hopefully, has been addressed appropriately.

When Roberto Sassu and Krzysztof Struczynski contacted me about the
status of Stefan Berger's patch set, based on Yuqiong Sun's work, I was
under the impression that they would be rebasing it on the latest
kernel and going forward from there.   Obviously things changed.  I
pointed out to them resolving the "IMA namespacing" issue would be the
first thing that needs to be addressed.  So here we are.

Definitely, let's have this discussion.
