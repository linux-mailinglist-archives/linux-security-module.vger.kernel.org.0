Right, and I'm saying that it's too coarse-grained to be a proper
building block in its own right. As evidenced by the need for adding an
LSM on top to do anything fine-grained; a task which is decidedly
non-trivial to get right, BTW. Which means that the path of least
resistance is going to be to just grant a token and not bother with the
LSM, thus ending up with this being a giant foot gun from a security
PoV.

Your objection to that was that it was too much of a hack to read all
the target process memory (etc) from the policy daemon, which I
acknowledged and suggested a way of keeping the kernel in the loop so it
can take responsibility for the gnarly bits while still allowing
userspace to actually make the decision:

(Last two paragraphs). Maybe that message just got lost somewhere on its
way to your inbox?

I'm not expecting veto rights, I'm objecting to being ignored. The way
this development process is *supposed* to work (as far as I'm concerned)
is that someone proposes a patch series, the community provides
feedback, and discussion proceeds until there's at least rough consensus
that the solution we've arrived at is the right way forward.

If you're going to cut that process short and just pick and choose which
comments are worth addressing and which are not, I can't stop you,
obviously; but at least do me the favour of being up front about it so I
can stop wasting my time trying to be constructive.

Anyhow, I guess this point is moot for this discussion since I'm about
to leave for vacation for four weeks and won't be able to follow up on
this. Apologies for the bad timing :/ I'll ping some RH folks and try to
get them to keep an eye on this while I'm away...

A sysctl similar to the existing one for unprivileged BPF would be fine
as well. If an LSM ends up being the only way to control it, though,
that will carry so much operational overhead for us to get to a working
state that it'll most likely be simpler to just patch it out of the
kernel.
