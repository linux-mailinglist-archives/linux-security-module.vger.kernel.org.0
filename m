Hi Günther,
﻿
Thank you for the detailed analysis and the clear breakdown. 
Apologies for the delayed response. I spent the last couple of days
thoroughly reading through the previous mailing list discussions. I
was trying hard to see if there was any viable pure lockless design
that could solve this concurrency issue while preserving the original
architecture. 
﻿
However, after looking at the complexities you outlined, I completely
agree with your conclusion: serializing the TSYNC operations is indeed
the most robust and reasonable path forward to prevent the deadlock.
﻿
Regarding the lock choice, since 'cred_guard_mutex' is explicitly
marked as deprecated for new code in the kernel,maybe we can use its
modern replacement: 'exec_update_lock' (using down_write_trylock /
up_write on current->signal). This aligns with the current subsystem
standards and was also briefly touched upon by Jann in the older
discussions.
﻿
I fully understand the requirement for the two-part patch series:
1. Cleaning up the cancellation logic and comments.
2. Introducing the serialization lock for TSYNC.
﻿
I will take some time to draft and test this patch series properly. 
I also plan to discuss this with my kernel colleagues here at 
UnionTech to see if they have any additional suggestions on the 
implementation details before I submit it.
﻿
I will send out the v1 patch series to the list as soon as it is
ready. Thanks again for your guidance and the great discussion!
﻿
Best regards,
Yihan Ding
