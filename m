Other trust anchors for "trusted keys" has been discussed, but I wasn't
aware of any discussion about other trust anchors for the IMA
measurement list.  The IMA measurement list is very much tied to a TPM.

Including container measurements in the host measurement list, will
unnecessarily cause the host measurement list to grow.  The decision of
what should and shouldn't be included in the host measurement list
shouldn't be defined by the container.
