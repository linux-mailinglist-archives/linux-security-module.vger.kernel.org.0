This patch set addresses two very different issues - allowing keys on
the platform keyring to be trusted for things other than verifying the
kexec kernel image signature, overwriting the arch specific IMA secure
boot policy rules.  The only common denominator is basing those
decisions on UEFI variables, which has been previously suggested and
rejected.  The threat model hasn't changed.

The desire for allowing a single local CA key to be loaded onto a
trusted keyring is understandable.  A local CA key can be used to sign
certificates, allowing them to be loaded onto the IMA keyring.  What is
the need for multiple keys? 

Making an exception for using a UEFI key for anything other than
verifying the kexec kernel image, can not be based solely on UEFI
variables, but should require some form of kernel
agreement/confirmation.  If/when a safe mechanism for identifying a
single local CA key is defined, the certificate should be loaded
directly onto the secondary keyring, not linked to the platform
keyring.

The system owner can enable/disable secure boot.  Disabling the arch
secure boot IMA policy rules is not needed.  However, another mechanism
for enabling them would be acceptable.

thanks,

Mimi
