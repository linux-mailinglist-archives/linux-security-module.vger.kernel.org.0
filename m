I think semantics matter here. I wouldn't view this as _bypassing_
capability enforcement: it's just more fine-grained access control.

For example, in many places we have things like:

	if (!some_check(...) && !capable(...))
		return -EPERM;

I would expect this is a similar logic. An operation can succeed if the
access control requirement is met. The mismatch we have through-out the
kernel is that capability checks aren't strictly done by LSM hooks. And
this series conceptually, I think, doesn't violate that -- it's changing
the logic of the capability checks, not the LSM (i.e. there no LSM hooks
yet here).

The reason CAP_BPF was created was because there was nothing else that
would be fine-grained enough at the time.
