Landlock is a LSM.  Landlock properties *are* LSM properties/attributes, 
regardless of data types.  Look at a lot of the recent work to support 
arbitrary types in the LSM syscalls as well the very recent work to start 
moving away from the rigid secctx/secid concepts within the kernel.

Landlock is a LSM and just as all the other LSMs integrate with other areas 
of the kernel through the LSM framework, so should Landlock. Instead of 
adding landlock_* calls in the kernel, you need to adding security_* calls, 
or better yet, finding ways to work with existing security_* calls.

I don't disagree that including LSM info in the existing PID_GET_INFO API 
would be preferable, see my request at the 2024 LPC session on this as well 
as some discussions with Luca, but you will see that Christian has blocked 
this idea and forced us into a LSM specific API. It's not ideal in my 
opinion, but it is better than nothing or having to do our solution in the 
LSM space.
