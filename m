The concept of the IMA namespace as a separate namespace, not attached to
the user or mount namespace, remains the same as in the last set of
Stefan's patches. The creation and configuration mechanism changed,
partially because of the changes in the upstream kernel like extension of
the CLONE_ flags, that facilitated other solutions. The main inspiration
in this regard was the new time namespace.

The implemented mechanism is intended to make the configuration of the IMA
namespace as similar as possible to the upstream IMA implementation and
allows to configure the new IMA namespace before any process enters that
namespace, so the very first actions can be measured/appraised/audited.

In this implementation many design points formulated by Stefan still stand.
The significant difference in the presented design is the threat model.
The actions of the host's root and any other user within the container are
measured/appraised/audited according to the container's policy. However,
every action that affects objects in the root namespace, is detected when
processes from the root namespace access them.

Best regards,
Krzysztof
