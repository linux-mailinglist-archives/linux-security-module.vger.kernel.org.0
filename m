This is a new feature, so it's on the person proposing the feature to explain
why it's useful.  The purpose of "encrypted" keys is not at all clear, and the
documentation for them is heavily misleading.  E.g.:

    "user space sees, stores, and loads only encrypted blobs"
    (Not necessarily true, as I've explained previously.)

    "Encrypted keys do not depend on a trust source" ...  "The main disadvantage
    of encrypted keys is that if they are not rooted in a trusted key"
    (Not necessarily true, and in fact it seems they're only useful when they
    *do* depend on a trust source.  At least that's the use case that is being
    proposed here, IIUC.)

I do see a possible use for the layer of indirection that "encrypted" keys are,
which is that it would reduce the overhead of having lots of keys be directly
encrypted by the TPM/TEE/CAAM.  Is this the use case?  If so, it needs to be
explained.
