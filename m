+Trust Source provides the source of security for the Trusted Keys, on which
+basis Trusted Keys establishes a Trust model with its user. A Trust Source could
+differ from one system to another depending on its security requirements. It
+could be either an off-chip device or an on-chip device. Following section
+demostrates a list of supported devices along with their security properties/
+guarantees:
 
-TPM 2.0
--------
+  *  Root of trust for storage
 
-The user must first create a storage key and make it persistent, so the key is
-available after reboot. This can be done using the following commands.
+     (1) TPM (Trusted Platform Module: hardware device)
+
+         Rooted to Storage Root Key (SRK) which never leaves the TPM that
+         provides crypto operation to establish root of trust for storage.
+
+     (2) TEE (Trusted Execution Environment: OP-TEE based on Arm TrustZone)
+
+         Rooted to Hardware Unique Key (HUK) which is generally burnt in on-chip
+         fuses and is accessible to TEE only.
+
+  *  Execution isolation
+
+     (1) TPM
+
+         Fixed set of operations running in isolated execution environment.
+
+     (2) TEE
+
+         Customizable set of operations running in isolated execution
+         environment verified via Secure/Trusted boot process.
+
+  * Optional binding to platform integrity state
+
+     (1) TPM
+
+         Keys can be optionally sealed to specified PCR (integrity measurement)
+         values, and only unsealed by the TPM, if PCRs and blob integrity
+         verifications match. A loaded Trusted Key can be updated with new
+         (future) PCR values, so keys are easily migrated to new PCR values,
+         such as when the kernel and initramfs are updated. The same key can
+         have many saved blobs under different PCR values, so multiple boots are
+         easily supported.
+
+     (2) TEE
+
+         Relies on Secure/Trusted boot process for platform integrity. It can
+         be extended with TEE based measured boot process.
+
+  *  On-chip versus off-chip
+
+     (1) TPM
+
+         Off-chip device connected via serial bus (like I2C, SPI etc.) exposing
+         physical access which represents an attack surface that can be
+         mitigated via tamper detection.
+
+     (2) TEE
+
+         On-chip functionality, immune to this attack surface.
+
+  *  Memory attacks (DRAM based like attaching a bus monitor etc.)
+
+     (1) TPM
+
+         Immune to these attacks as it doesnâ€™t make use of system DRAM.
+
+     (2) TEE
+
+         An implementation based on TrustZone protected DRAM is susceptible to
+         such attacks. In order to mitigate these attacks one needs to rely on
+         on-chip secure RAM to store secrets or have the entire TEE
+         implementation based on on-chip secure RAM. An alternative mitigation
+         would be to use encrypted DRAM.
+
+  *  Side-channel attacks (cache, memory, CPU or time based)
+
+     (1) TPM
+
+         Immune to side-channel attacks as its resources are isolated from the
+         main OS.
+
+     (2) TEE
+
+         A careful implementation is required to mitigate against these attacks
+         for resources which are shared (eg. shared memory) with the main OS.
+         Cache and CPU based side-channel attacks can be mitigated via
+         invalidating caches and CPU registers during context switch to and from
+         the secure world.
+         To mitigate against time based attacks, one needs to have time
+         invariant implementations (like crypto algorithms etc.).
+
+  *  Resistance to physical attacks (power analysis, electromagnetic emanation,
+     probes etc.)
+
+     (1) TPM
+
+         Provides limited protection utilizing tamper resistance.
+
+     (2) TEE
+
+         Provides no protection by itself, relies on the underlying platform for
+         features such as tamper resistance.
+
+
+Key Generation
+==============
+
+Trusted Keys
+------------
+
+New keys are created from trust source generated random numbers, and are
+encrypted/decrypted using trust source storage root key.
+
+  *  TPM (hardware device) based RNG
+
+     Strength of random numbers may vary from one device manufacturer to
+     another.
+
+  *  TEE (OP-TEE based on Arm TrustZone) based RNG
+
+     RNG is customizable as per platform needs. It can either be direct output
+     from platform specific hardware RNG or a software based Fortuna CSPRNG
+     which can be seeded via multiple entropy sources.
+
+Encrypted Keys
+--------------
+
+Encrypted keys do not depend on a trust source, and are faster, as they use AES
+for encryption/decryption. New keys are created from kernel generated random
+numbers, and are encrypted/decrypted using a specified â€˜masterâ€™ key. The
+â€˜masterâ€™ key can either be a trusted-key or user-key type. The main disadvantage
+of encrypted keys is that if they are not rooted in a trusted key, they are only
+as secure as the user key encrypting them. The master user key should therefore
+be loaded in as secure a way as possible, preferably early in boot.
