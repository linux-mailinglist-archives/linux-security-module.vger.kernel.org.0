You are proving yourself that you are completely trapped into
"only in-tree and supported by distributors is correct" crap.

I am an individual who don't belong to specific distribution. Most of Linux users
in companies I relate with are using RHEL. Company's financial support for TOMOYO
terminated in March 2012 because I was not able to establish support/consult business
because I was not able to get TOMOYO enabled in RHEL (even in Fedora).

My support for TOMOYO is still continued, but unless loadable LSMs becomes legally
possible, I can't introduce TOMOYO/CaitSith to Linux users in companies I relate with.

Even if your LSM stacking work completes some day, I can imagine that there will be
no LSMs I can stack (unless loadable LSMs becomes legally possible).
Finding a distribution who want loadable LSMs does not help.
Only that loadable LSMs becomes legally possible without kernel config option helps.

What I'm asking you are that:

  Please don't lock out out-of-tree LSM modules (by requiring an LSM id integer value
  which are assigned to only in-tree LSM modules) because we can't accept whatever LSM
  modules as in-tree.

  Please don't lock out loadable LSM modules (by using fixed sized array) because
  locking out loadable LSM modules reduces the value of your LSM stacking work.

Quite simple.
