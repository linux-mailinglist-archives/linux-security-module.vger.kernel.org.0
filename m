The driver is the OpenAFS filesystem. I'm not a developer for or expert in=

OpenAFS, but from the stack, it appears to be updating a disk transaction=20
database to reflect a removed directory. It seems this happens to work most=
 of=20
the time but does not play nice with LSMs.

OK, this is what I figured; thanks for confirming. Sounds like OpenAFS shou=
ld=20
be patched to do this work in a kernel context.
