I haven't really looked into that so I'm not comfortable commenting on
that.  I can say that in off-list discussions with Sush, Tushar, and
others the issue we are facing is general memory pressure so using any
type of memory backed filesystem doesn't really resolve our problem.

That feels like a normal part of the design, review, and iterate cycle
to me.  Sush and Tushar are following along and I'm sure they will
take all of that into account in the next revision of the design
document.
