Thanks for the quick reply. If I understand correctly, I should follow 
the first pattern if I want to use the inode blob.

My work will be related to the IPE LSM we proposed before. For the inode 
blob, we want to use it to save some file data like FSVerity signature 
so that the LSM can define policy based on that data.
