LANDLOCK_ACCESS_FS_MAKE_SOCK is only required to bind/listen to a
socket, not to connect.  I guess you was thinking about
LANDLOCK_ACCESS_FS_RESOLVE_UNIX in this case?

This looks too complex and would intertwine both concept, which is more
confusing IMO.

I'd like to keep a clean API, with a "scoped" field handling IPC
scoping, and an "handled_access_fs" field handling filesystem-related
accesses.

One thing to keep in mind is that we could add a new kind of "handled"
field that would enable to add rules identifying e.g. processes,
cgroups, or Landlock domains, and that could be used to add exceptions
to the current scopes.  This means that we need to have a generic way to
handle this case.

What is the issue with two complementary interfaces (scope and access)
used to express a policy about connecting to UNIX sockets?  We just need
to make sure that scopes and handled_access_fs dealing with UNIX sockets
are like binary OR: if the scope is set, then the domain can communicate
with peers which are in the same domain, and if the handled_access_fs
right is set, then the domain can only communicate with matching sockets
(OR scoped ones if the scope is set).

My main concern is about user space libraries and users that may want to
have conditional enforcement for compatibility reasons e.g., only
enforce LANDLOCK_SCOPE_PATHNAME_UNIX_SOCKET (let's say ABI v8) if it can
also set LANDLOCK_ACCESS_FS_RESOLVE_UNIX (let's say ABI v9).  I see two
ways to deal with this case (if needed):
- add synthetic access right to easily let users "combine" two access
  rigths or none;
- have a more generic way to AND and OR access rights.  I'm thinking
  about updating the Rust library in this direction.

Anyway, we need to decide if this should be merged in Linux 7.0 (next
week) or not.  I'd prefer to merge it now because I think it works well
and it's not a new concept wrt the abstract UNIX socket scoping.
However, if there are any concern, I'd like to hear them now and I can
delay this merge if needed.  This patch series still need a new version
but that should only be about cosmetic fixes.  WDYT?
