You're probably right. In my email I said it could be "fine for occasional use" where users
want to trace the system when a problem occurs.
Of course this only works if the problem is reproducible (or frequent enough) that you can
build a new kernel with TOMOYO enabled, boot on it, and wait for the problem to produce itself.
If the goal is instead to have TOMOYO enabled at all time on the company systems, then I
do not envy Tetsuo's position, because I believe this to be an impasse (regarding TOMOYO
itself, not necessarily the tracing problem - more on that later).

I personally does not agree with the position that "there is little needs for updating
packages due to security bugs", because I believe this does not account for one important
source of attacks: the internal actor, working inside the company, and thus behind all
your WAF/IPS/Firewalls and whatnot (I do not say this to belittle these tools, they help
protect your company against external actors, but they do not protect against a malicious
or angry employee). So updates (not just security updates, after all in the kernel it is
very hard to know what update carries a security fix) are always a good thing in my book.

But fair enough, I have also seen the "If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it" quite a fair
amount of time in a few years working with the industry. And when you cannot justify
investing money into upgrades with your hierarchy, you have to compromise.

Anyway, I sidetracked myself again :/

The difficulty is that the LSM community need to think of what's best for all users,
and that include users where the writable static calls may be an exploitable path.
If RedHat were to enable TOMOYO_LKM, they would expose their users to that risk.
Thus, I do not believe (as maybe have said already) that your patch would serve
your objective of getting it added into RedHat, but rather the contrary: guaranteeing
that RedHat will never enable it in Fedora/RHEL kernels.

While I sympathize with your position (between the anvil of not getting TOMOYO enabled
in distributions and the hammer of your customers in need of solutions), I do not
think this design of a LKM updating static calls that provide security functions
holds a real chance of getting merged someday.


On another note, the way the patch was sent to Linus (very close to the end of the
merge window, and without CC'ing the linux-security-module ML) may be seen as a way
to bypass reviewers and get it merged "no matter what". While I do not attribute
malice to that merge request, I understand that it may be somewhat ill perceived.
Which again, may warp RedHat's (and others, like Canonical's) perception of TOMOYO
negatively.
Maintaining a piece of kernel functionality for over a decade in an impressive feat,
and I commend you for that, but I know that losing trust is often far easier (and takes
far less effort) than regaining it afterwards.
And I think the "trust credit" may play an important role in the political aspects
of enabling a kernel feature on a given distribution.

Finally, I must admit that I know nearly nothing of both TOMOYO and BPF-LSM.
Nevertheless, for your tracing needs (this may not work well for enforcing a
policy, but I kind of inferred from your emails that you were mostly interested
in tracing/debugging capabilities), may you could reproduce the necessary functionalities
of TOMOYO via BPF-LSM?
I don't presume to know the complexity of that endeavor, nor how the limitations of
the ePBF verifier may make that partial rewrite difficult (and it certainly would be).
But it seems to me that you have three options:
- Get TOMOYO LKM merged, and wait a few years for it to be enabled by distros, readily
  available then deployed by your customers
- Pressure distributions into enabling TOMOYO (without the LKM), and wait a few years too
- Provide an eBPF program that can instrument LSM operations to extract the tracing information
  you need to debug your customers. You may also have to wait a few years to get the full
  feature set of TOMOYO working, or to get eventual missing features enabled in BPF-LSM, but
  a limited version may work on many kernels (even existing ones), and updates would be
  easier (not tied to a specific kernel version).

I am not saying that BPF-LSM is THE solution - it has too many limitations for that - but if
you desire to have a LSM for tracing needs (again, not for enforcement, where you cannot afford
to have a userland process load the BPF program) that you can update at will without rebooting,
that does not create new potential security issues (if we ignore speculative execution attacks
in eBPF), there is some appeal to that idea.
