Different use case scenarios have different requirements.  Suppose for
example that the group creating the kernel image is not the same as
using it.  The group using the kernel image could sign all files,
including kernel modules (imasig), with their own private key. Only
files that they signed would be permitted.  Your proposal would break
the current expectations, allowing kernel modules signed by someone
else to be loaded.
