This is why I wanted to add a separate pointer in struct inode so that
we could share the implementation with tracing. bpf_local_storage
is managed (per-program+per-type of storage) with separate BPF maps.
So, it can be easily shared between two programs (and
program types) without them clobbering over each other.

I guess we can have separate pointers for tracing,
use the pointer in the security blob for the LSM and discuss this separately
if and when we use this for tracing and keep this series patches scoped to
BPF_PROG_TYPE_LSM.
