I apologize for the delay in responses, but it looks like
you've figured it out.

This kind of thing is exactly what IPE's design is supposed to
solve, you have some other system which provides the
integrity mechanism and (optionally) determine if it is trusted or
not, and IPE can provide the policy aspect very easily to
make a set of system-wide requirements around your mechanism.

I'm very supportive of adding the functionality, but I wonder
if it makes more sense to have digilm's extension be a separate
key instead of tied to the fsverity_digest key - something like

    op=EXECUTE diglim_fsverity=TRUE action=DENY

that way the condition that enables this property can depend
on digilm in the build, and it separates the two systems'
integrations in a slightly more clean way.

As an aside, did you find it difficult to extend?
