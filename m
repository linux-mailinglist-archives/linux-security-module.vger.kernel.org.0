A rule is indeed a set of access rights tied to an object.  However,
when the same object is used with two calls to landlock_add_rule(), the
ruleset's rule is the union of both access rights.

What I wanted to highlight is that the quiet flag is unrelated to the
access rights, which makes sense because the otherwise it would never be
denied and then never logged.

Adding a new field to rule types would allow to only mute denied
requests if they match an access right, instead of muting all
non-allowed access rights.  For instance, if an app tries to do an ioctl
because of legacy/compatibility reasons, we may want to ignore such
request, but we may still want to log malicious attempts to modify
regular files (in the same file hierarchy).

This hack should definitely not be encouraged, otherwise the limit of 16
layers will shrink to 8 (or less) in practice.

Yes, that will indeed increase the size of rules, which is why I'm not
sure if it worth it.

The alternative I was thinking about is to only increase the size of
struct landlock_ruleset (which would be negligible) to include sets of
quiet access rights.  A request to such access right *on* a quiet object
would never be logged.  I think this approach is flexible enough and
doesn't increase much the complexity.  This would also be useful to not
log access rights that don't have associated rules (e.g. scopes), and
then no identified objects.  To avoid the kind of hack you pointed out,
this feature should probably be part of this patch series though.  What
do you think?
