You're not the only one to suggest this.  There are at least a few
things that make this extremely difficult if not impossible.  For
example, consider this code:

void maybe_buggy(void)
{
  int a, b;
  int *p =3D &a;
  int *q =3D (int *)some_function((unsigned long)p);
  *q =3D 1;
}

If some_function(&a) returns &a, then all is well.  But if
some_function(&a) returns &b or even a valid address of some unrelated
kernel object, then the code might be entirely valid and correct C,
but I don't see how the runtime checks are supposed to tell whether
the resulting address is valid or is a bug.  This type of code is, I
think, quite common in the kernel -- it happens in every data
structure where we have unions of pointers and integers or where we
steal some known-zero bits of a pointer to store something else.
