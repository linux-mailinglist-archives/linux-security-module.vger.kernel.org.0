SELinux applies access control across the entire system, regardless of
what namespaces may be configured on the system.  Loading a SELinux
policy in the host/initial-namespace during early boot helps ensure
proper labeling of system entities and a better user experience;
loading a SELinux policy in a container/namespace can lead to
surprising and unpredictable results across the whole of the system.
AppArmor is different in that it has support for
containers/namespaces.  Running SELinux on the host and AppArmor in a
container isn't so much about preventing collisions, they are still
simultaneously running and applying their security policies, it is
more about ensuring the LSMs, the admins, and the users all see
compatible views of the system.

Please do not confuse any of the above as a 'nested' or namespaced LSM
layer; the current in-progress LSM stacking is simply that: the
ability to stack some combination of LSMs in a few prescribed
configurations.  Talking about 'nesting' or 'namespacing' at the LSM
layer is confusing at best, and misleading at the worst.
