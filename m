Hi Sumit, =20

Thank you for the detailed descriptions and examples of trust sources =
for Trusted Keys.   A group of us in IBM (Stefan Berger, Ken Goldman, =
Zhongshu Gu, Nayna Jain, Elaine Palmer, George Wilson, Mimi Zohar) have =
been doing related work for quite some time, and we have one primary =
concern and some suggested changes to the document.=20

Our primary concern is that describing a TEE as a Trust Source needs to =
be more specific.   For example, "ARM TrustZone" is not sufficient, but =
"wolfSSL embedded SSL/TLS library with ARM TrustZone CryptoCell-310" is. =
 Just because a key is protected by software running in a TEE is not =
enough to establish trust.  Just like cryptographic modules, a Trust =
Source should be defined as a specific implementation on specific =
hardware with well-documented environmental assumptions, dependencies, =
and threats.

In addition to the above concern, our suggested changes are inline =
below.

please add the following:

* Provisioning - the trust source's unique and verifiable cryptographic =
identity is provisioned during manufacturing

(1) TPM
The unique and verifiable cryptographic identity is the endorsement key =
(EK) or its primary seed.  A review of the generation of the EK and its =
accompanying certificate is part of the Common Criteria evaluation of =
the product's lifecycle processes (ALC_*).  See "TCG Protection Profile =
for PC Client Specific TPM 2" =
(https://trustedcomputinggroup.org/resource/pc-client-protection-profile-f=
or-tpm-2-0/).

(2) TEE
A protection profile for TEEs does not yet exist.  Therefore, the =
provisioning process that generates the Hardware Unique Key is not =
evaluated by an independent third party and is highly dependent on the =
manufacturing environment. =20


* Cryptography
(1) TPM
As part of the TPM's mandatory Common Criteria evaluation, the =
correctness of the TPM's implementation of cryptographic algorithms, the =
protection of keys, and the generation of random numbers, and other =
security-relevant functions must be documented, reviewed, and tested by =
an independent third party evaluation agency.  It must meet the =
requirements of FIPS 140-2, FIPS 140-3, or ISO/IEC 19790:2012.=20

(2) TEE
Evaluations of cryptographic modules within TEEs are not required, but =
some are available for specific implementations within TEEs.



* Interfaces and APIs
(1) TPMs have well-documented, standardized interfaces and APIs.
(2) Unless they implement functionality such as a virtual TPM, TEEs have =
custom interfaces and APIs.=20



* Threat model
The strength and appropriateness of  TPMs and TEEs for a given purpose =
must be assessed when using them to protect security-relevant data.   =20=


We suggest documenting environmental assumptions and dependencies in a =
high-level threat model for each additional trust source.  Just as each =
new LSM needs to comply with Documentation/security/lsm-development.rst, =
each new Trusted Key source should provide a high-level threat model.   =
An example of a high-level threat model is "Common Security Threats =
v1.0=E2=80=9D =
(https://www.opencompute.org/documents/common-security-threats-notes-1-pdf=
 ).=20

The original Trusted Keys implementation assumed discrete physical TPMs =
for key protection.  However, even physical TPMs themselves vary based =
on the manufacturer and systems in which they are placed.  The embedded =
chipset, firmware load, algorithms, packaging, pins, and countermeasures =
vary.  (Threats and mitigations on physical TPMs are well documented, =
e.g., "Threat Model of a Scenario Based on Trusted Platform Module 2.0 =
Specification=E2=80=9D (http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-1011/6.pdf).

Specific to Trusted Keys and TPMs, there is some discussion of threats =
and mitigations in the Integrity_overview.pdf on the IMA wiki:

	=E2=80=A2 The trusted key component does two things to help with =
secure key management on Linux. First, it provides a kernel key ring =
service in which the symmetric encryption keys are never visible in =
plain text to userspace. The keys are created in the kernel, and sealed =
by a hardware device such as a TPM, with userspace seeing only the =
sealed blobs. Malicious or compromised applications cannot steal a =
trusted key, since only the kernel can see the unsealed blobs. Secondly, =
the trusted keys can tie key unsealing to the integrity measurements, so =
that keys cannot be stolen in an offline attack, such as by booting an =
unlocked Linux image from CD or USB.  As the measurements will be =
different, the TPM chip will refuse to unseal the keys, even for the =
kernel.

Consumers of Trusted Keys in different environments need enough =
information so that they can create their own threat models tailored to =
their use cases.  For the present submission, a high-level security =
model of ARM TrustZone and how Trusted Keys key protection is =
implemented along with an enumeration of security considerations for =
end-use threat models would be appropriate. =20

An excellent and related paper describes the strengths, weaknesses, and =
countermeasures of a firmware TPM implemented within a TEE.  See "fTPM: =
A Software-only Implementation of a TPM Chip=E2=80=9D =
(https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity16/technical-sessions/pre=
sentation/raj)

Please change the following
"New keys are created from trust source generated random numbers, and =
are encrypted/decrypted using trust source storage root key."
to
"New keys are created from random numbers generated in the trust source. =
They are encrypted/decrypted using a child key in the storage key =
hierarchy.  Encryption and decryption of the child key must be protected =
by a strong access control policy within the trust source. =E2=80=9C
