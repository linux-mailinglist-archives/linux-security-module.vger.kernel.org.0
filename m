Yes, it should.  The seccomp_merge() API was created for applications,
like systemd, that create multiple per-ABI filters but still wanted to
consolidate the multiple filters into one, either to add common rules
or reduce the number of filters loaded into the kernel.

Since the motivation behind the seccomp_merge() API was to help make
it easier to create complex filters for multiple ABIs, it is limited
to merging filters that do not share any of the same ABIs.  For
example, you could merge a filter that contains a x86 ABI with another
filter that contains x86_64 and x32 ABIs but you can *not* merge two
filters that both contain x86 ABIs.  This greatly simplifies the merge
operation and makes it fairly quick.

If you try it and run into any problems let Tom (CC'd) or I know and
we will try to help you guys out.

The lack of any real stability in error codes was my fault, we really
should have done it sooner but I felt there were bigger issues to
focus on at the time.  Regardless, starting with v2.5.0 we will have
stable error codes that are documented in the manpages; the number of
errors, and the associated documentation, may be relatively limited to
start with, but it should improve over time as we get feedback.

Okay, let me try this again ...

In the context of this discussion it looks like limiting the number of
seccomp filters loaded into the kernel is desirable and one way to do
that with libseccomp is to use the seccomp_merge() API to consolidate
multiple per-ABI filters into one "megafilter" (I like that term)
which can be loaded into the kernel.  Does that make more sense?

Perhaps others will clarify, but from my reading of this thread there
is a performance advantage to be gained by limiting the number of
seccomp filters installed for a given process.
