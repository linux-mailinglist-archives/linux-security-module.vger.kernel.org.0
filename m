This patch fixes the (absolute) rule access rights, which now always 
forbid LANDLOCK_ACCESS_FS_REFER except when it is explicitely allowed 
when creating a rule. Making all domain handle LANDLOCK_ACCESS_FS_REFER 
was may initial approach but there is two downsides:
- it makes the code more complex because we still want to check that a 
rule allowing LANDLOCK_ACCESS_FS_REFER is legitimate according to the 
ruleset's handled access rights (i.e. ABI v1 != ABI v2);
- it would not allow to identify if the user created a ruleset 
explicitely handling LANDLOCK_ACCESS_FS_REFER or not, which will be an 
issue to audit Landlock (not really possible right now but soon ;) ).

The difference with the current approach is only in the 
get_handled_accesses() and init_layer_masks(), instead of patching the 
ruleset enforcement.

Ah! From my point of view it is not a good API because it is a moving 
one (without notice). Keeping a copy of the originally requested 
handled_access_fs works but consumes data memory for something that can 
be done with the code, hence this solution.
