I think that's a good idea.  The new hook would more generic and make it
possible to have more context to take an access control decision, which
is better for the LSM framework.

This proposal make sense, improve IPC restriction consistency (by always
be able to connect to peers from the same domain), and would simplify
some checks.  What bother me the most is the implicit scoping induced
by the FS_RESOLVE_UNIX handling.  A related issue is the mix of checks
for the FS_RESOLVE_UNIX implementation, which could make the code more
complex, but I don't see a better way.  Landlock already has an implicit
ptrace scoping but it's not (and should never be) optional.

See my proposal below about implicit
LANDLOCK_SCOPE_PATHNAME_UNIX_SOCKET.  That would not change the kernel
checks you described though.

In this case, we need to assume the scoped flag is already there, and
because we have the implementation, to actually add it now.

As a side note, I don't really like this landlock_scope_attr interface.
A dedicated attr per kind of IPC would be much more flexible (e.g. the
handled_signal_number you described below).  For instance, even if at
first we don't make it possible to describe different signals within the
attr struct, this struct will be able to grow.  So it's better to have a
dedicated interface per IPC type than a generic scope interface that can
only express a subset of it.

Anyway, this proposal could work for pathname UNIX sockets, but a future
signal attr would be a bit inconsistent wrt to the pathname UNIX one.

What about always implicitly set LANDLOCK_SCOPE_PATHNAME_UNIX_SOCKET (in
the kernel) when LANDLOCK_ACCESS_FS_RESOLVE_UNIX is set?

*Requiring* users to set LANDLOCK_SCOPE_PATHNAME_UNIX_SOCKET would add a
new way to trigger an error, but setting
LANDLOCK_SCOPE_PATHNAME_UNIX_SOCKET *implicitly* looks safer.  This
might also help for the documentation BTW.

If we agree on this, I could merge the scope_pathname_unix in 7.0, and
merge the resolve_unix in 7.1 (or later if something unexpected happen).
Otherwise, I'll merge both at the same time with the same ABI version
(with the risk to postpone again).  WDYT?
