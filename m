I think we could deal with that using origin call_ macro only if the 
following cases that alloc a task, socket, make a file and so forth 
which do newing objects and subjects that must have both security 
context for preventing a security state that would be muddled. On the 
other hands, in a case of operations that like read, load, mmap are to 
call the customized call_ macro with ilsm to conditionally branch.

Could you explain the latter one, please?
