My comments were not meant as suggestions, but as an explanation as to
how IMA works.  More details follow.

IMA is based on policy.  That decision was made a long time ago.  It
allowed distros to configure IMA, allowing customers to experiment
with it.  You have one opportunity to totally change the boot time
policy rules, by loading a custom policy.  After that, rules may only
be added.

There is no valid reason for "turning off" the policy once it has been
enabled.  It breaks existing expectations.
