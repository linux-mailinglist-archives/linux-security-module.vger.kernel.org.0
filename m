I think the thing to do is use /proc/sys/kernel/cap_last_cap (if it
exists) to compare *caps to ~(cap_last_cap-1) and for each bit where
it's the same, show the full set.  Been looking at the fn for a bit,
and I might be comfortable enough to try it at this point.  But, if
you want to do it (to make sure it's done right :), please let me know.
