Subject: [PATCH 0/8] ima: support stronger algorithms for attestation

IMA extends Platform Configuration Registers (PCRs) of the TPM to give a
proof to a remote verifier that the measurement list contains all
measurements done by the kernel and that the list was not maliciously
modified by an attacker.

IMA was originally designed to extend PCRs with a SHA1 digest, provided
with the measurement list, and was subsequently updated to extend all PCR
banks in case a TPM 2.0 is used. Non-SHA1 PCR banks are not supposed to be
used for remote attestation, as they are extended with a SHA1 digest padded
with zeros, which does not increase the strength.

This patch set addresses this issue by extending PCRs with the digest of
the measurement entry calculated with the crypto subsystem. The list of
algorithms used to calculate the digest are taken from
ima_tpm_chip->allocated_banks, returned by the TPM driver. The SHA1 digest
is always calculated, as SHA1 still remains the default algorithm for the
template digest in the measurement list.

This patch set also makes two additional modifications related to the usage
of hash algorithms. First, since now the template digest for the default
IMA algorithm is always calculated, this is used for hash collision
detection, to check if there are duplicate measurement entries.

Second, it uses the default IMA hash algorithm to calculate the boot
aggregate, assuming that the corresponding PCR bank is currently allocated.
Otherwise, it finds the first PCR bank for which the crypto ID is known.
IMA initialization fails only if no algorithm known to the crypto subsystem
is found.

This patch set does not yet modify the format of the measurement list to
provide the digests passed to the TPM. However, reconstructing the value of
the quoted PCR is still possible for the verifier by calculating the digest
on measurement data found in binary_runtime_measurements.

The attest-tools library [1] has been updated to verify non-SHA1 PCR
banks [2] and to handle non-SHA1 boot aggregate [3].

Roberto Sassu (8):
  tpm: initialize crypto_id of allocated_banks to HASH_ALGO__LAST
  ima: evaluate error in init_ima()
  ima: store template digest directly in ima_template_entry
  ima: switch to dynamically allocated buffer for template digests
  ima: allocate and initialize tfm for each PCR bank
  ima: calculate and extend PCR with digests in ima_template_entry
  ima: use ima_hash_algo for collision detection in the measurement list
  ima: switch to ima_hash_algo for boot aggregate
