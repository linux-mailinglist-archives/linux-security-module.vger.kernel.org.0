Yes, that is the goal. Since you said

  "Until I hear the real limitations of using BPF, it's a NAK from me."

at https://lkml.kernel.org/r/CACYkzJ5k7oYxFgWp9bz1Wmp3n6LcU39Mh-HXFWTKnZnpY-Ef7w@mail.gmail.com ,
I want to know whether it is possible to re-implement TOMOYO LSM as an eBPF program.

If it is possible to re-implement TOMOYO LSM as an eBPF program, my desire to
allow appending LKM-based LSMs after boot will be significantly reduced, which
in turn will become my ACK to "security: Count the LSMs enabled at compile time"
in your "Reduce overhead of LSMs with static calls" proposal.

The code which I want to re-implement using eBPF is all of security/tomoyo/ directory.

TOMOYO needs to be able to call d_absolute_path() in order to calculate
requested pathname, call call_usermodehelper(UMH_WAIT_PROC) in order to load
policy upon activation, call get_mm_exe_file() in order to know the pathname
of executable, get_user_pages_remote() in order to examine argv/envp passed to
execve() system call etc. etc. in addition to performing complicated comparison
including loop like https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v6.6-rc6/source/security/tomoyo/group.c#L120 .

If any of above requirements cannot be satisfied in eBPF, that will become
the real limitations of using BPF.

That's good but not enough. We will need to forbid unlink/umount because detach_program()
says "/* To unpin, it is necessary and sufficient to just remove this dir */". Hooking
security_inode_unlink()/security_sb_umount() and return an error if the requested file was
the eBPF version of TOMOYO (or maps etc. related to the eBPF version of TOMOYO) or the
requested filesystem was sysfs might be able to forbid "unpin" operation... That would be
the next step to check if re-implementing all of security/tomoyo/ directory using eBPF
is possible...
