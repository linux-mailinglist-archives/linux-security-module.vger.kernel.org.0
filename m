Thanks, but no worries.  Work in this space long enough and everyone
eventually ends up sending a mail or two that could have been worded
better, myself included.

My main concern is the duplication between the cred check and the cred
override functions leading to a bug at some unknown point in the
future.  Changes to credential checking, and access control in
general, always gets my attention and due to past bruises I'm very
sensitive to out-of-sync issues due to code duplication; so your patch
was a bit of a "perfect storm" of concern for me :)

The profiling questions were mainly there as a curiosity since it
looked like this was part of a larger performance oriented effort and
I thought you might have more data that didn't make it into the commit
description.

That wording looks good to me and would help me feel a bit better
about this change, thank you.
