I indeed felt a bit ridiculous introducing a new LSM for a limited feature
like that!
What's more, I don't see it being extended much in the future - we could
always imagine things like signed policy updates, but other than that it's
probably "feature-complete", as the feature itself is fairly small.
The difficulty with LoadPin is that it rely relies on the notion of
filesystem (which is coupled with the origin of the kernel modules) to ensure
that modules are valid. On a general-purpose distributions, the modules
would be stored on the same (non-integrity-verified) filesystem, so
segregating the modules by filesystem is not really possible there.
Extending LoadPin to provide the same features is probably possible, but I
fear this would add complexity to loading by trying to make it do two
slightly different jobs at once.

CC-ing Kees Cook as he is the maintainer of the LoadPin module, he may have
opinions on what features may or may not fit inside LoadPin.

As for other LSMs, I don't really see one that tries to provide similar
features, but I someone is open to extending an existing LSM for that, I
would be happy to help.

To stop the proliferation of LSMs (if this proves to be a problem),
I could see a "miscellaneous" one that groups the tiny LSMs (which each
feature set hidden behind a configuration option), like loadpin, yama,
safesetid, and future feature sets like loadpol.

I understand the concern, but the idea of the LSM is not to substitute itself
to existing security mechanisms (as you know, it technically couldn't anyway, LSM
being all about stacking additional layers).
So we still rely on kernel module signing. To forge a malicious module with a valid
name, one would have to have access to the signing key. If that happens, I consider
the game to be over, as they can forge arbitrary kernel modules.
In most practical cases, I think people will trust two keys:
- the distributor key, built in the kernel
- User-supplied keys, distributed via MOK (or in the UEFI KEK maybe?)
Most modules would be signed with the distributor key, with security software
(or custom kernel drivers) being signed with the user key (hopefully off-system,
so that the end-users systems do not contain the signing key, otherwise this
defeats the whole point of signing).
All modules would still be signed, and we should be safe from a module lying about
its name (naming conflicts notwithstanding, but this shouldn't happen anyway).
But I could have an explanation in the documentation about that!
