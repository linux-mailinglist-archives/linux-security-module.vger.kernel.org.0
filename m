This doesn't sound like a good idea: filesystems accept control
characters in names, so the IMA file policy has to be able to specify
them.  We can debate whether filesystems should do this, but while they
do IMA has to as well.

I don't quite understand what you think the problem is.  Only root can
write IMA policies so no-one other than a legitimate administrator can
use bogus paths like the above.  If the problem is producing a bogus
log message, we do have several IMA messages that print out
measured/appraised file names ... they would be vulnerable to this
since a generic user could have created them with control character
containg file names, and your proposed patch wouldn't fix that.

Wouldn't a better solution be to have a file name print that expands
the unprintable characters?
