Mimi, do you keep missing the part in my replies where I mention that
I don't really care as long as the trimming and aggregate both make it
into the kernel?  I don't agree with your assertion that the two
pieces of functionality are independent, but it doesn't really matter
as long as the functionality is in place, userspace can be made to do
what Tushar and Sush need to do.

I still don't understand why you've brought SELinux into this, it
makes no sense from my perspective as the two are "separate,
independent features".  Are you trying to draw some odd parallel
between snapshotting and IMA/SELinux?  I guess I'd suggest just
dropping this comparison and focusing on more concrete things like
"the aggregate should contain X, Y, and Z", etc. as that is something
we can all understand and use as a starting point to continue to make
forward progress.
