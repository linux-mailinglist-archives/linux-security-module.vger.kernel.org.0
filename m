Here's my long'ish analysis. Please read it to the end if by ever means
possible, and apologies, I usually try to keep usually my comms short, but
this requires some more meat than the usual.

The Bad News
============

Now that we add multiple hardware trust sources for trusted keys, will
there ever be a scenario where a trusted key is originally sealed with a
backing hardware A, unsealed, and resealed with hardware B?

The hardware and vendor neutral way to generate the key material would be
unconditionally always just the kernel RNG.

CAAM is actually worse than TCG because it's not even a standards body, if
I got it right. Not a lot but at least a tiny fraction.

This brings an open item in TEE patches: trusted_tee_get_random() is an
issue in generating kernel material. I would rather replace that with
kernel RNG *for now*, because the same open question applies also to ARM
TEE. It's also a single company controlled backing technology.

By all practical means, I do trust ARM TEE in my personal life but this is
not important.

CAAM *and* TEE backends break the golden rule of putting as little trust as
possible to anything, even not anything weird is clear at sight, as
security is essentially a game of known unknowns and unknown unknowns.

Unfortunately, TPM trusted keys started this bad security practice, and
obviously it cannot be fixed without breaking uapi backwards compatibility.

This leaves me exactly two rational options:

A. Add a patch to remove trusted_tee_get_random() and use kernel RNG
   instead.
B. Drop the whole TEE patch set up until I have good reasons to believe
   that it's the best possible idea ever to use TEE RNG.

Doing does (A) does not disclude of doing (B) later on, if someone some
day sends a patch with sound reasoning.

It's also good to understand that when some day a vendor D, other than TCG,
CAAM or ARM, comes up, we need to go again this lenghty and messy
discussion. Now this already puts an already accepted patch set into a
risk, because by being a responsible maintainer I would have legit reasons
just simply to drop it.

OK, but....

The GOOD News
=============

So there's actually option (C) that also fixes the TPM trustd keys issue:

Add a new kernel patch, which:

1. Adds the use of kernel RNG as a boot option.
2. If this boot option is not active, the subsystem will print a warning
   to klog denoting this.
3. Default is of course vendor RNG given the bad design issue in the TPM
   trusted keys, but the warning in klog will help to address it at least
   a bit.
4. Document all this to Documentation/security/keys/trusted-encrypted.rst.

I'd prefer the choice between A, B and C be concluded rather sooner than
later.
