I don't think it is a matter of lack of interest or not caring.  The
challenge becomes whether or not a business case exists for expending
the resources and navigating the challenges needed to advance
infrastructure for inclusion in the kernel.

As I noted in my previous e-mail, I believe the path forward is not to
figure out how to address the rather complex and invasive issue of how
to namespace IMA, but instead, needs to be what a flexible
'next-generation' architecture for platform behavioral assessment
looks like.

In a larger context, I believe the future for security is going to
involve at a minimum the kernel, and more likely, something tightly
coupled to the kernel, making active decisions on whether or not a
behavior that the kernel is contemplating mediating is consistent with
platform or container security policy.

To frame this a bit, the well understood role of the kernel with
respect to security is to mediate 'Turing Events', or Actor/Subject
(A/S) interactions.  Both DAC and MAC are based on this concept with
the interface between an Actor and Subject being a security 'gate'.

Given this model, the most simplistic and direct path forward is to
provide a namespace capable method of exporting a description of the
identity parameters that characterize the entities involved in an A/S
interaction.  The kernel, or as I previously suggested as more likely
moving forward, a closely linked entity can then make a decision as to
whether or not the behavior should be allowed.

FWIW, as an example of the minimal impact of this method, here is the
diffstat of such an implementation:

As can be seen, this was built out in the context of the IMA
sub-system with the majority of the changes being encapsulated in one
file.  This includes all of the infrastructure needed for a Trusted
Execution Environment (TEE) to enforce kernel security policy
decisions.

In addition to a container specific representation of the current
behavioral state, each namespace exports via a sysfs pseudo-file, the
following behavioral definition for each A/S interaction.

exchange pid{1} event{cboot:/home/greg/runc} actor{uid=0, euid=0, suid=0, gid=0, egid=0, sgid=0, fsuid=0, fsgid=0, cap=0x3fffffffff} subject{uid=50, gid=50, mode=0100755, name_length=15, name=f0da604ff3f0a3e16163bc9d2f99bb9bcd70397d211b746d0104299972cc5505, s_id=sda1, s_uuid=1bfef8aaa45f4bcaa846640ae4547ddc, digest=791a7cf8dec2afe302836b974b3c0f7b0a5983f76d857aa97658ce09d54f60f8}

Which provides the framework for implementing any number of policy
decisions, of which integrity is only one element.

We had initially used SGX to implement a TEE based enforcement engine,
but given the direction of hardware support, we have largely shelved
our SGX development efforts in favor of using a micro-controller based
approach.

Given what appears to be the direction for mobile devices, a
collection of specialized harware linked by an OS, the notion of a
separate entity making security policy decisions seems relevant.

Trying to implement supportable and field maintainable 'trusted
computing' is a fools errand without the notion of containerization of
platform behavior.  This is true whether the target is the cloud or
endpoint/IOT class devices.

It seems well understood, that while containers are not a first class
kernel entity, the kernel takes responsibility for implementing
compartmentalization of resources.  It would seem that security event
characterizations are consistent with that model.

In addition, none of this works without developer support.  Framing
behavior assessment in the form of containers means that behavioral
trajectory definitions for the containers can be a byproduct of
standard DEVOP's pipelines.

As I've noted previously, namespacing IMA is problematic, what is
needed is something far simpler and more flexible that provides a
framework for implementing policy outside of the kernel, or if in the
kernel, in a highly customizable fashion.

I think that it would be found that user namespaces bring too much
baggage to the table.  The most effective path forward in this venue
would seem to be to bring forward the most simplistic, flexiable and
uncomplicated mechanism possible.

In this model, classic IMA would serve as a trust root on whose
shoulders a security orchestration framework stands.

Hopefully the conversation will benefit from actual field experience
with doing this sort of thing in a supportable fashion.

The concept of 'trusted computing' has been around since the days when
Dave Grawrock designed TXT, which is heavily linked to the heritage of
IMA.  The fact that effective solutions in widespread practice have
not emerged, in the face of demonstrated need, suggests the need to
develop new solution strategies.

Just to be clear, we are not campaigning or advocating what we have
done but are simply providing background for discussion.  We haven't
campaigned this approach given how complex the kernel development has
become, particurlarly with respect to security infrastructure.

Candidly, given the politics of security technology being viewed as
'constraining' user rights, I think that a lot of forthcoming security
technology may end up being out of tree moving forward.
