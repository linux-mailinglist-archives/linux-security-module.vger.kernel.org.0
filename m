Thanks, that would certainly be a much better stop gap measure until
such time as the mount API can properly be mediated by AppArmor.

We did some research with Aleksa last night and that does seem to be
true for the profiles we could find.

However there is a bit of a catch that Docker, Kubernetes, ... pretty
much all the application container options do support using AppArmor
but don't provide advanced profiles, instead they put the burden on
the user to attach profiles to specific containers.

I have no idea how many people actually do that and since they are
individually crafted profiles by those users, we have no idea what may
be in there and whether they got broken by this change.

I think that'd be useful to have as something that can be used to
detect this behavior from userspace and have the affected code turn
off mount mediation if that's the case.

That'd be good. I feel that if this change had come with the ENOSYS
behavior, I wouldn't have noticed it at all.
With the new mount API being still pretty fresh, I'm not aware of any
userspace which today relies exclusively on it, so having it be
effectively disabled until such time as you can mediate it properly
shouldn't really break anyone (always hard to know, but sure would
break a lot less cases than the current change).

One catch though from my testing with seccomp, to make this work, you
need to have fsmount return ENOSYS, if you only have move_mount return
ENOSYS, it's too late and libmount just returns the failure to the
user rather than go down the old mount API code path.

Sure, but I suspect we could have avoided a bunch of pain if we had a
chat around this change, had an opportunity to test it ahead of time.
At the very least, we'd have had the flag file introduced from the
start and hopefully some better handling like some kind of ENOSYS
option.
