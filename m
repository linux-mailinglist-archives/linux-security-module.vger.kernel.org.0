I've believe the LSM developer community is interesting in that it is
much smaller than many other kernel subsystems, despite the
substantial technical scope when one considers the LSM's reach within
the kernel.  This brings about a number of challenges, the largest
being that reviewing ideas, documents, and code changes takes time.
Everyone always wants their personal patchset to land "right now!",
but it's important that the changes are given the proper review and
testing.  You don't have to look any further than the recent static
call changes to see a perfect example of how overly aggressive
attitudes toward merging would have resulted in a number of real world
failures.  I agree that a quicker pace would be nice, but I'm not
willing to trade off reliability or correctness so people's favorite
feature can land in Linus' tree a bit quicker.

Independent of everything above, it is important to note that the pace
of changes in the LSM framework over the past two years has increased
significantly.  Even ignoring some of the administrative improvements,
e.g. process documentation, since 2022 the LSM community has been
merging code at a pace much higher than we've seen during the entirety
of the "git age":

[NOTE: using 'security/security.c' to be representative of LSM
framework specific changes seems reasonable for a quick metric]

I disagree.  I've personally reviewed two of your LSM revisions,
providing feedback on both.  Unfortunately both times I've not made it
past the documentation as there have been rather significant issues
which I didn't believe were properly addressed from one revision to
the next.  From what I've seen on the mailing list, others have
identified similarly serious concerns which in my opinion have not
received adequate responses.

The TSEM LSM is still queued for review, but based on prior reviews it
currently sits at a lower priority.  I realize this is frustrating,
but I have to prioritize work based on impact and perceived quality.
