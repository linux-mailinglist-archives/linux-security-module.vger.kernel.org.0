What you are looking for is a combination of LSM stacking and
individual LSM namespacing.  Sadly, I think the communications around
LSM stacking have not been very clear on this and I worry that many
people are going to be disappointed with LSM stacking for this very
reason.

While stacking of LSMs is largely done at the LSM layer, namespacing
LSMs such that they can be customized for individual containers
requires work to be done at the per-LSM level as each LSM is
different.  AppArmor already has a namespacing concept, but SELinux
does not.  Due to differences in the approach taken by the two LSMs,
namespacing is much more of a challenge for SELinux, largely due to
issues around filesystem labeling.  We have not given up on the idea,
but we have yet to arrive at a viable solution for namespacing
SELinux.

If you are interested in stacking SELinux and AppArmor, I believe the
only practical solution is to run SELinux on the host system (initial
namespace) and run AppArmor in the containers.  Even in a world where
SELinux is fully namespaced, it would likely still be necessary to run
some type of SELinux policy on the host (initial namespace) in order
to support SELinux policies in the containers.
