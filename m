The UM process here would be typically an attestation client
which passes on the IMA log to the remote service for attestation.
If the process doesn't run, the client will operate the same way as it
does currently.

Kernel triggering snapshot would come with its own issues of Kernel
storing the snapshot on some persistent file-system. They are being
discussed on the main thread [1].

In this design, reading the PCR plus adding the snapshot_aggregate
has to be an atomic operation.  Other IMA events shouldn't interfere
with this operation. Just like IMA ensures adding an entry to the log
plus PCR extension happens in an atomic way by holding the
ima_extend_list_mutex [2], we intend to use a similar mechanism to
ensure reading the PCR plus adding the snapshot_aggregate remains an
atomic operation.  And since taking a snapshot would be a rare event
compared to adding a generic event to IMA log - overall we expect a low
overhead in case of snapshotting.

However, please note that the event addition to IMA logs will *not*
be paused while the log is written out to disk by the UM process.

Earlier we believed the PCR update counter will help with keeping track
of events in the IMA log snapshot. But I soon realized (and it was
also pointed out by Stefan Berger on the PCR update counter patch-series 
[3]) that the update counter gets incremented on updates to any PCR
(including the PCRs not touched by IMA).

I agree that update counter may not be a reliable marker for this
particular feature.

We have put that series [3] on hold for other higher priority work items
in the IMA/kexec space.

The goals of snapshot_aggregate marker are:
     1. To allow the IMA log to be divided into multiple chunks and
        provide attestation service the ability to verify and use the
        latest chunk (i.e. snapshot ) for attestation.

     2. To indicate to the attestation service that the client device has
        IMA log snapshotting feature enabled, and at least one snapshot
        is taken.  So that the service can ask for previous snapshots
        as needed.

     3. In the event of multiple snapshots, the snapshot_aggregate
        marker has sufficient information to verify the integrity
        of latest subset of isolated snapshots (with the help of PCR
        quote of course)

     4. snapshot_aggregate helps both kernel and UM define clear
        boundaries between multiple snapshots.
        (each new snapshot starts with either the first boot_aggregate
         or a snapshot_aggregate event)

The overall goals of IMA log snapshotting feature are:
     a. to relieve memory pressure on the client device.

     b. to make attestation service side processing more efficient
        They don't have to deal with the entire log since boot,
        as you mentioned on

     c. Reduce network bandwidth usage by sending less data
        for each attestation request.

We missed stating them explicitly in the original RFC proposal we
sent. We will add them in the next version of the proposal.
