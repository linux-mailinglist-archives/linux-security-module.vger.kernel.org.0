Nice. Do you intend to use the same property that powerpc uses
(linux,ima-kexec-buffer)?

If I'm not mistaken, the code at arch/powerpc/kexec/ima.c isn't actually
powerpc-specific. It could be moved to an arch-independent directory and
used by any other architecture which supports device trees.

I think that's the simplest way forward. And to be honest I'm still
trying to understand why you didn't take that approach. Did you try it
and hit some obstacle or noticed a disadvantage for your use case?
