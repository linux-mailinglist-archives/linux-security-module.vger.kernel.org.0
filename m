I think setting a calendar reminder once per week to check this
mailing list for any SafeSetID related patches/mail sounds reasonable
and something I can commit to. Keeping the same @chromium.org email
for me is fine, I'll let you guys know if I lose access or have
trouble logging in at some point and we can get the email updated, but
I don't anticipate that happening.

Thanks,
Micah
