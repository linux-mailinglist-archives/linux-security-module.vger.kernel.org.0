I intentionally avoided talking about this. You see, the trusted key documentation[1]
phrases it as "all keys are created in the kernel", but you consider
"'The key material is generated
 within the kernel' [a] misleading claim'. [2]

Also, I hope patches to force kernel RNG and CAAM support (using kernel RNG as
default) will soon be accepted, which would invalidate any further claims in the
commit message without a means to correct them.

I thus restricted my commit message to the necessary bit that are needed to
understand the patch, which is: userspace knowledge of the key material is
not required. If you disagree, could you provide me the text you'd prefer?

In the context of *kernel trusted keys*, direct interaction with the TPM
outside the kernel to decrypt a kernel-encrypted blob is surely not the
preferred way.

For TPM-bound encryption completely in userspace? Maybe. But that's not
what this patch is about. It's about kernel trusted keys and offloading
part of its functionality to userspace to _work around_ lack of kernel-side
integration is exactly that: a _work around_.

Yes. The content of the note is more appropriate there.

Will do for v3.

For v3 with helper functions, there will be one indentation level less,
so this will be less 79 again instead of 87.

Oh, good point. I think I cargo-culted it off encrypted key support for
eCryptfs and dm-crypt. Encrypted keys don't support revoke either..

That might be reasonable, but perhaps the error code in that

Yes. It was like this for v1, but I missed it when dropping the
dependency on the key_extract_material patch. Will fix for v3.
