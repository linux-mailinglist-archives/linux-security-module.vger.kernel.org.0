Paul, there are two features: 
- trimming the measurement list
- defining and including an IMA critical data record

The original design doc combined these two features making them an "atomic"
operation and referred to it as a snapshot.  At the time the term "snapshot" was
an appropriate term for the IMA critical record.  Now not so much.

These are two separate, independent features.  Trimming the measurement list
should not be dependent on the IMA critical data record.  The IMA critical data
record should not be dependent on trimming the measurement list.  Trimming the
measurement list up to the (first/last/Nth) critical data record should be
optional.

The IMA critical data record should not be that different or more difficult,
than the SELinux critical data record.  Only if you conflate the two features
being discussed - trimming the IMA measurement list and the IMA critical data
record - does it become "far more".
