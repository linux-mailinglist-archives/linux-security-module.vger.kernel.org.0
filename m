I guess such approach can be used with some limitations: the out-of-tree
module must be open source, the vendor of the module must commit to
fixing (inevitable) module build issues when the distro updates its
kernel and so on. It, however, doesn't help the users which want to
build and sign their own modules themselves.

(FWIW, RH-signed UKI is already present in RHEL/Fedora/derivatives along
with a set of good known UKI cmdline extentions ('fips=3D1',
'crashkernel=3D...',...) so adding e.g. 'platform_is_trusted=3D1' extension
*is* possible).

So if we consider trusting/not trusing platform to be a distro choice
("politics"), then I guess the suggested Kconfig approach may make
sense? I, however, quite like the idea to complement it with an
automatic toggle based on the MOK status: we can make the Kconfig a
tristate:
- Platform is never trusted (current approach)
- Platform is always trusted
- Platform is trused when MOK is not used
To me, this third option makes sense: if a user wants to take ownership
over the system, they can use MOK and sign the kernel itself and/or
out-of-tree modules with it. If the user doesn't care, then there's no
reason to not trust 'db'.
