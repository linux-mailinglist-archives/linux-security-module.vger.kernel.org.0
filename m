Update documentation for Trusted and Encrypted Keys with TEE as a new
trust source. Following is brief description of updates:

- Add a section to demonstrate a list of supported devices along with
  their security properties/guarantees.
- Add a key generation section.
- Updates for usage section including differences specific to a trust
  source.

+============
 
-By default, trusted keys are sealed under the SRK, which has the default
-authorization value (20 zeros).  This can be set at takeownership time with the

+A trust source provides the source of security for Trusted Keys.  This
+section lists currently supported trust sources, along with their security
+considerations.  Whether or not a trust source is sufficiently safe depends
+on the strength and correctness of its implementation, as well as the threat
+environment for a specific use case.  Since the kernel doesn't know what the
+environment is, and there is no metric of trust, it is dependent on the
+consumer of the Trusted Keys to determine if the trust source is sufficiently
+safe.

-The user must first create a storage key and make it persistent, so the key is

+     (1) TPM (Trusted Platform Module: hardware device)
+
+         Rooted to Storage Root Key (SRK) which never leaves the TPM that
+         provides crypto operation to establish root of trust for storage.
+
+     (2) TEE (Trusted Execution Environment: OP-TEE based on Arm TrustZone)
+
+         Rooted to Hardware Unique Key (HUK) which is generally burnt in on-chip
+         fuses and is accessible to TEE only.
+
+  *  Execution isolation
+
+     (1) TPM
+
+         Fixed set of operations running in isolated execution environment.
+
+     (2) TEE
+
+         Customizable set of operations running in isolated execution
+         environment verified via Secure/Trusted boot process.
+
+  * Optional binding to platform integrity state
+
+     (1) TPM
+
+         Keys can be optionally sealed to specified PCR (integrity measurement)
+         values, and only unsealed by the TPM, if PCRs and blob integrity
+         verifications match. A loaded Trusted Key can be updated with new
+         (future) PCR values, so keys are easily migrated to new PCR values,
+         such as when the kernel and initramfs are updated. The same key can
+         have many saved blobs under different PCR values, so multiple boots are

+
+     (2) TEE
+
+         Relies on Secure/Trusted boot process for platform integrity. It can
+         be extended with TEE based measured boot process.
+
+  *  Interfaces and APIs
+
+     (1) TPM
+
+         TPMs have well-documented, standardized interfaces and APIs.
+
+     (2) TEE
+
+         TEEs have well-documented, standardized client interface and APIs. For
+         more details refer to ``Documentation/staging/tee.rst``.
+
+
+  *  Threat model
+
+     The strength and appropriateness of a particular TPM or TEE for a given
+     purpose must be assessed when using them to protect security-relevant data.
+
+
+Key Generation
+==============
+
+Trusted Keys
+------------
+
+New keys are created from random numbers generated in the trust source. They
+are encrypted/decrypted using a child key in the storage key hierarchy.
+Encryption and decryption of the child key must be protected by a strong
+access control policy within the trust source.
+
+  *  TPM (hardware device) based RNG
+
+     Strength of random numbers may vary from one device manufacturer to
+     another.
+
+  *  TEE (OP-TEE based on Arm TrustZone) based RNG
+
+     RNG is customizable as per platform needs. It can either be direct output
+     from platform specific hardware RNG or a software based Fortuna CSPRNG
+     which can be seeded via multiple entropy sources.
+
+Encrypted Keys
+--------------
+
+Encrypted keys do not depend on a trust source, and are faster, as they use AES
+for encryption/decryption. New keys are created from kernel-generated random
+numbers, and are encrypted/decrypted using a specified ‘master’ key. The
+‘master’ key can either be a trusted-key or user-key type. The main disadvantage
+of encrypted keys is that if they are not rooted in a trusted key, they are only
+as secure as the user key encrypting them. The master user key should therefore
+be loaded in as secure a way as possible, preferably early in boot.
