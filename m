The first use case doesn't sound like a valid reason for upstreaming
such support.  It's a one time update to migrate everyone to a newer
kernel.  That you can carry independently of upstream.  In terms of the
second use case, do you really want the ability and the resulting
responsibility of being able to decrypt user's data?   Please think
this through carefully, before you decide you really want/need this
feature.
