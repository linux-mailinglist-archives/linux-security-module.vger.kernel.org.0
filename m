Hi Kees,

I considered instrumenting the syscall instructions with calls to some
wrapper, but I was told that modifying the game in memory or on disk
will trigger all sorts of anti-cheating mechanisms (my main use case are
windows games).

Paul (cc'ed) is the wine expert, but my understanding is that memory
allocation and initial program load of the emulated binary will go
through wine.  It does the allocation and mark the vma accordingly
before returning the allocated range to the windows application.

yes:

root@dilma:~# sysctl -a | grep -i jit
net.core.bpf_jit_enable = 1
net.core.bpf_jit_harden = 0

I experimented with SECCOMP_RET_TRAP and SECCOMP_RET_TRACE, but I hadn't
consider USER_NOTIF.  It seems to be a quite recent feature and I wasn't
aware of it.  I will try it and let you know.

Right, will do.  I considered it, but wasn't sure if madvise semantics
gave any guarantees of the result, but is seems to be the case for at
least for WIPEONFORK.  it is important to have it configurable on mmap
too, to avoid the extra syscall.  Plumbing through the mmap flags
argument shouldn't be a problem.

Yes, agreed.  I guess it would be a real scenario, even for us, to have
isolation against malicious syscalls (MODE_FILTER) combined
with region protection (MEMAP) for emulation.

And 64-bit comparisons :)

that would be a good solution, we'd still need to look at some details,
like disabling/updating filters at runtime when some new library is
loaded, but since we can update externally, I think it covers it.

From the wine side, it should be enough to get the semantics we want,
but I don't know about performance.

Maybe it is worth to expose SECCOMP_FILTER_FLAG_LOG?

The results I shared in the previous email had the following filter:

  BPF_STMT(BPF_LD | BPF_W | BPF_ABS, (offsetof(struct seccomp_data, nr))),
  BPF_JUMP(BPF_JMP | BPF_JGE | BPF_K, 0xf000, 0, 1),
  BPF_STMT(BPF_RET | BPF_K, SECCOMP_RET_TRAP),
  BPF_STMT(BPF_RET | BPF_K, SECCOMP_RET_ALLOW),

Which is much much simpler than the real thing.  I also had a small
filter generator that generated segments like the following ( ip_HW and
ip_LW are the high and low part of the instruction pointer):

  0007: BPF_STMT(BPF_LD | BPF_W | BPF_ABS, ip_HW)
  0008: BPF_JUMP(BPF_JMP | BPF_JEQ | BPF_K, EH, 0, REL_ADDR(next))
  0009: BPF_STMT(BPF_LD | BPF_W | BPF_ABS, ip_LW)
  000a: BPF_JUMP(BPF_JMP | BPF_JGT | BPF_K, EL, REL_ADDR(next), 0)
  000b: BPF_JUMP(BPF_JMP | BPF_JGE | BPF_K, SL, REL_ADDR(filter->jump_allow_target), REL_ADDR(next))
  000c: next:
