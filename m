Yes, simpler is better.

Indeed. It should be notted that this new IOCTL access right will be the
first one to directly apply to both files and directories.  It should
then have the same scope as LANDLOCK_ACCESS_FS_READ i.e., apply to the
target directory itself and files/directories beneath it.

We then need to test a directory's IOCTL, for instance using FIOQSIZE.

What about this two rules and related access checks, combined with
already-opened FD?
- dir_s1d1: always denied (negative test)
- file1_s1d1: allowed with a rule (checks ACCESS_FILE)
- dir_s2d1: allowed with a rule (checks directory right)
