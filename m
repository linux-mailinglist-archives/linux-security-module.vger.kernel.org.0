Instead of making the reviewer look up the failed attempts, please
summarize why they failed (e.g. all preboot firmware keys were
trusted), and then continue, like below, with how this attempt differs.

Other archs will also want to allow loading "end-users" key.  Please
prefix this paragraph with something like "On UEFI based systems".

Replace "adds" with "defines".

Thank you for crediting me for limiting loading only the CA keys stored
in the MOK db onto the "machine" keyring, but the limitation should be
better integrated in the paragraph.

To differentiate this "signing_key" from others, perhaps name the file
"machine_sigining_key" or "local_signing_key".

thanks,
