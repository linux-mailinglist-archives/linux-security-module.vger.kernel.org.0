What you're performing are all bog standard key wrapping operations
which is why we're asking the question: do we have to expose any of
this to the user?  Can this whole thing not be encapsulated in such a
way that the kernel automatically selects the best key
escrow/accelerator technology on boot and uses it (if there are > 1
there would have to be an interface for the user to choose).  We make
all the accelerator device key formats distinguishable so the kernel
can figure out on load what is supposed to be handling them.  That way
the user never need worry about naming the actual key handler at all,
it would all be taken care of under the covers.

The one key type per escrow/accelerator has us all going ... "aren't
there hundreds of these on the market?"  which would seem to be a huge
usability explosion because a user will likely only have one, but they
have to figure out the type instructions for that one.  I really think
a better way is to have a more generic key type that's capable of
interfacing to the wrap/unwrap and crypto functions in such a way that
the end user doesn't have to know which they're using: most platforms
only have one thing installed, so you use that thing.
