Yeah, good idea: I can wipe out the pstore_private->dentry at this point
just for robustness. From what I could tell the evict got immediately
called after the dput().

Do you mean the d_drop() isn't needed? What happens if someone has
the file open during this routine? The goal here is to make these files
disappear so they'll go through evict.

> I have not looked at the locking in that series yet, so no comments

Yeah, I would not be surprised by some more locking issues, but I think
it's an improvement over what was there. Most of the code seems to have
been designed to be non-modular. :P

I'll change it; thanks!
