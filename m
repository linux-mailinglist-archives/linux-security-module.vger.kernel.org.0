I am not that comfortable with BPF programs but based on what Alexei Starovoitov pointed out here
https://lore.kernel.org/bpf/20221021164626.3729012-1-roberto.sassu@huaweicloud.com
BPF should not be able to write into the xattrs pointers. And thus shouldn't be included
in `evm_config_xattrnames[]`.

There is no valid reasons, I was just unsure about replacing existing functions, will update it.

I think that in its current state the kernel cannot load two LSM capable of xattr
initialization as they are all defined with the `LSM_FLAG_EXCLUSIVE` flag set.
But I may be unaware of other LSM in development stage.

No problem, will change it !

I'll take time to run few tests with BPF and send a patch v3 with new changes.
