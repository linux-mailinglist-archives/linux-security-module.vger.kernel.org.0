As it seems that this feature would not be appropriate for all use-cases and
threat models, I wonder if making it optional would be acceptable. Something
like:

config TRUSTED_KEYS_IMPORT
        bool "Allow creating TRUSTED KEYS from existing key material"
        depends on TRUSTED_KEYS
        help
          This option adds support for creating new trusted keys from existing 
          key material supplied by userspace, instead of using random numbers.
          As with random trusted keys, userspace cannot extract the plain-text 
          key material again and will only ever see encrypted blobs.
          
          This option should *only* be enabled for use in a trusted
          environment (such as during debugging/development or in a secured
          factory). Also, consider using 'keyctl padd' instead of 'keyctl add' 
          to avoid exposing the plain-text key on the process command line.

          If you are unsure as to whether this is required, answer N.

Best regards,
Jan
