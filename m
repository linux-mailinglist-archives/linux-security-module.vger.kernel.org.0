Well, my use case at that time (I was at the university) was to provide
a secure storage based on TPM. I'm not aware of users of this
functionality, but I believe that it is reasonable (depending on how
trusted keys are used, the secure storage is available only on a
specific platform and if the software configuration is good). This
secure storage would be even more effective if it is coupled with
Mandatory Access Control, to release sensitive data only to the
legitimate applications.

I also don't think it is a good idea to remove this functionality.

Jarkko, we were discussing about this issue in another thread, and your
answer then (https://lkml.org/lkml/2019/3/21/396) was that it is a
priority to fix the regression.

The patch I proposed (https://lkml.org/lkml/2019/8/2/1282, I will apply
Tyler's comments) is not invasive and fixes the issue. If the digests
pointer is still NULL, pcrlock() returns an error.

Regarding Mimi's proposal to avoid the issue by extending the PCR with
zeros, I think it also achieve the goal. The purpose of pcrlock() is to
prevent unsealing of sealed data outside the kernel. If PCR values do
not change, sealed data can be unsealed and misused by a user space
process.

Extending the PCR with any value would be sufficient, as the extend
operation (the only way to update PCRs) was designed in a way that
finding the value that would be passed to the extend operation to obtain
again one of the previous PCR values is computationally infeasible.
