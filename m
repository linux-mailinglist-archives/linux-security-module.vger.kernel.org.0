The purpose of the blacklist keyring is to block new keys from being
loaded in the kernel. For builtin and dbx/mokx hashes, they are loaded
in the blacklist keyring before builtin certificates are loaded in the
trusted builtin keyring, which can reject them if there is a match. I
think that being able to load a blocked hash at run time should not
change the semantic of the blacklist keyring, which is to block the
loading of certificates. If someone wants to change this semantic, I
think it should be configurable. Indeed, we should keep in mind the
temporal dimension and the hierarchy of trust: dbx/mokx -> builtin
hashes -> run time hashes.
