EVM portable signatures are particularly suitable for the protection of
metadata of immutable files where metadata is signed by a software vendor.
They can be used for example in conjunction with an IMA policy that
appraises only executed and memory mapped files.

However, until now portable signatures can be properly installed only if
the EVM_ALLOW_METADATA_WRITES initialization flag is also set, which
disables metadata verification until an HMAC key is loaded. This will cause
metadata writes to be allowed even in the situations where they shouldn't
(metadata protected by a portable signature is immutable).

The main reason why setting the flag is necessary is that the operations
necessary to install portable signatures and protected metadata would be
otherwise denied, despite being legitimate, due to the fact that the
decision logic has to avoid an unsafe recalculation of the HMAC that would
make the unsuccessfully verified metadata valid. However, the decision
logic is too coarse, and does not fully take into account all the possible
situations where metadata operations could be allowed.

For example, if the HMAC key is not loaded and it cannot be loaded in the
future due the EVM_SETUP_COMPLETE flag being set, it wouldn't be a problem
to allow metadata operations, as they wouldn't result in an HMAC being
recalculated.

This patch set extends the decision logic and adds the necessary exceptions
to use portable signatures without turning off metadata verification and
deprecates the EVM_ALLOW_METADATA_WRITES flag.

More in detail, patch 1 allows EVM to be used without loading an HMAC key.
Patch 2 avoids appraisal verification of public keys (they are already
verified by the key subsystem).

Patches 3-4 still allow to turn off metadata verification but in a safe way
(by ensuring that IMA revalidates metadata when there is a change).

Patches 5-8 extend the decision logic to keep the metadata verification on,
by ignoring the INTEGRITY_NOLABEL and INTEGRITY_NOXATTS errors when
possible, by accepting any metadata modification until signature
verification succeeds (useful when xattrs/attrs are copied sequentially
from a source) and afterwards by only allowing operations that don't change
metadata.

Patch 9 deprecates the EVM_ALLOW_METADATA_WRITES flag after the decision
logic has been extended with the above exceptions.

Patch 10 makes it possible to use portable signatures when the IMA policy
requires file signatures and patch 11 shows portable signatures in the
measurement list when the ima-sig template is selected.

Lastly, patch 12 avoids undesired removal of security.ima when a file is
not selected by the IMA policy.

  clarify how <securityfs>/evm should be used (suggested by Mimi)
- rename evm_status_revalidate() to evm_revalidate_status() (suggested by
  Mimi)

  inline (suggested by Mimi)
- improve readability of error handling in evm_verify_hmac() (suggested by Mimi)
- don't show an error message if the EVM status is INTEGRITY_PASS_IMMUTABLE
  (suggested by Mimi)

  by kernel test robot)
- fix return value of evm_xattr_change() (suggested by Christian Brauner)

  Mimi)

v4:

v3:
- introduce evm_ignore_error_safe() to correctly ignore INTEGRITY_NOLABEL
  and INTEGRITY_NOXATTRS errors

- introduce IMA post hooks ima_inode_post_setxattr() and
  ima_inode_post_removexattr()
- remove ima_inode_removexattr()
- ignore INTEGRITY_NOLABEL error if the HMAC key is not loaded

v1:
- introduce EVM_RESET_STATUS integrity flag instead of clearing IMA flag
- introduce new template field evmsig
- add description of evm_xattr_acl_change() and evm_xattr_change()
