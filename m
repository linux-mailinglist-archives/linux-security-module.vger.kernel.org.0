I think it should be possible to using existing task locking semantics
to manage the statistics, but I'll need to take a closer look.

It's good to clarify what the expected behaviors should be; however,
while working with the resulting system, it wasn't clear what the threat
model was for this defense. I think we need two things: clear
descriptions of what is expected to be detected (and what is not), and a
set of self-tests that can be used to validate those expectations.

Also, what, specifically, does "fatal error" cover? Is it strictly fatal
signals? (i.e. "error" might refer to exit code, for example.)

Hm, is this already tracked in some other way? i.e. the family hierarchy
of the mm struct? They're only shared on clone, but get totally copied on
fork(). Should that be the place where this is tracked instead? (i.e. I
could fork and totally rearrange my VMAs.)

Instead of a list, can't the rate just be calculated on an on-going
basis?

Here's where I think the threat model needs some more work. The above
describes what I think is a less common situation. I expect the common
attack to hold still with a single value, and let the fork/exec spin
until the value lines up. (i.e. a fork is required.)

Here are the threat scenarios that come to mind for me:

1- launching (fork/exec) a setuid process repeatedly until you get a
   desirable memory layout (e.g. what Stack Clash[1] did).

2- connecting to an exec()ing network daemon (e.g. xinetd) repeatedly
   until you get a desirable memory layout (e.g. what CTFs do for simple
   network service[2]).

3- launching processes _without_ exec (e.g. Android Zygote[3]), and
   exposing state to attack a sibling.

4- connecting to a fork()ing network daemon (e.g. apache) repeatedly
   until you expose the previously-shared memory layout of all the other
   children (e.g. kind of related to HeartBleed[3], though that was a
   direct exposure not a crasher).

In each case, a privilege boundary is being crossed (setuid in the first,
priv-changes in the 2nd, and network-to-local in the latter two), so I
suspect that kind of detail will need to play a part in the design to
help avoid false positives.

Regardless, when I tested this series, 1 and 3 isn't detected, since
they pass through an execve(), and I think that needs to be covered as
well.

How do you see this being used?

I wonder if these will be needed as we narrow in on the specific threat
model (i.e. there will be enough additional signal to obviate this
tuning).

And in testing I found another false positive that I haven't fully
diagnosed. I found that at boot, with Docker installed, "runc" would
immediately trip the mitigation. With some debugging added, I looks like
runc had several forked processes that got SIGKILLed in quick succession,
and then the entire group got killed by Brute. I haven't narrowed down
what runc is doing here, but it makes me wonder if there might need
to be an exception for user-space delivered signals, as opposed to
kernel-delivered signals...

Thanks again for the work! I'm liking the idea of getting a solid
protection for this. It's been a long-standing hole in upstream. :)
