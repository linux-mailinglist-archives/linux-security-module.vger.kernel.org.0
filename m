This is why I added the comments in fs/exec.c's redundant checks. When I
was originally testing this series, I had entirely removed the checks in
fs/exec.c, but then had nightmares about some kind of future VFS paths
that would somehow bypass do_open() and result in execve() working on
noexec mounts, there by allowing for the introduction of a really nasty
security bug.

The S_ISREG test is demonstrably too late (as referenced in the series),
and given the LSM hooks, I think the noexec check is too late as well.
(This is especially true for the coming O_MAYEXEC series, which will
absolutely need those tests earlier as well[1] -- the permission checking
is then in the correct place: during open, not exec.) I think the only
question is about leaving the redundant checks in fs/exec.c, which I
think are a cheap way to retain a sense of robustness.
