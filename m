In an effort to help preserve the sanity of admins, I might suggest
avoiding commands that start with a dash/'-'.  I'd probably also
simplify the commands a bit and drop all/'A' since the measurement
list could change at any time, stick with an explicit number and just
let the admin go over, e.g. write LONG_MAX, which effectively becomes
'A'.  I think you could do everything you need with just two commands:

  <NUM>: stage <NUM> entries
      D: delete staged entries

I intentionally left out the trim/'T' command, because I'm not sure it
is really necessary if you are going to implement the phased
stage/delete process.  Yes, you have to do two operations (stage and
delete) as opposed to just the trim, but I'd probably take the
simplicity of just supporting a single approach over the trivial
necessity of having to do two operations in userspace.

Staging also has the benefit of having a sane way of handling two
tasks racing to stage the measurement list.  I could see cases where
multiple tasks race to trim the list and end up trimming more than was
intended since they both hit in sequence.

If you did want to take a trim approach over a stage/delete approach,
I could see something like this working:

 1. process opens the measurement list
 2. process reads from the measurement list, keeps the fd open
 3. process does whatever it wants to preserve the list
 4. process writes <NUM> to the measurement list, kernel trims <NUM> entrie=
s
 5. process closes fd

... error handling shouldn't be too bad.  The process only writes
<NUM> to the fd if it has already finished whatever it needs to do to
preserve the list outside the kernel, think of it as a "commit"
operation on a transaction.  If the fd is closed for some reason
(error, interruption, killed) before the process writes <NUM> to the
fd then IMA does nothing - no trim takes place.

Multiple process racing can easily be solved when the log is opened;
only one open(O_RDWR) is allowed at a time, other racing processes
will get EBUSY.  Yes, one process could block others from trimming by
holding the fd open for an extended period of time, but I would expect
that CAP_SYS_ADMIN and root fs perms would be required to open the log
read/write (not to mention any LSM access rights in place).

I know I mentioned this basic idea to someone at some point, but there
have been various discussion threads and multiple people over a fairly
lengthy time that I've lost track of where it was mentioned.  If it
was already discussed on-list and rejected for a good reason you can
simply ignore the above approach ... although I still think the
stage/delete API could be simplified as described :)

[UPDATE: as I'm reading Steven's replies it looks like he has proposed
something very similar to the above]
