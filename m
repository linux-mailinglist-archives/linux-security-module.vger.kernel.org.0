Assuming OP-TEE has the same use model as the TPM, someone will
eventually realise the need for interoperable key formats between key
consumers and then it will work in the same way once the kernel gets
updated to speak whatever format they come up with.

Yes, that's what I was thinking ... especially when you can add policy
to the keys, which includes PCR locking.  Part of the problem is that
changing policy, which you have to do if something happens to update
the PCR values, is technically a migration, so your trusted keys for
dm-crypt are really going to have to be migrateable.

What about a third option: why not make dm-crypt store the master key
it uses as an encrypted key (if a parent trusted key is available)? 
That way you'd be able to extract the encrypted form of the key as
root, but wouldn't be able to extract the actual master key.
