Probably not surprising, given that Quixote has been architected and
stewarded by three Ph.D.'s, one soon to be Ph.D. and a rather
remarkable individual that has four Ph.D.'s worth of experience, if I
can choose my phrasing carefully, in global cyber-operations of
various types.

In the theory portion of the documentation we attempted to draw
correlations between classic mandatory access control and integrity
architectures and what we are implementing with Quixote/TSEM.

Clarifications to the theory section and a Wikipedia link have been
added and will appear in V5.

If we didn't believe that we have a solid technical solution in hand
within the context of this century, and groups that have asked for it
to be in the kernel, we wouldn't be expending cycles on getting it
upstreamed.

We are hoping for considerably better than 358 years, but that would
seem to be dependent on Linux review bandwidth, which everyone agrees
is strained.

More to the point, we were making an allusion with our comments that
throughout history, disruptive innovation has been consistently missed
by the technical status quo.

Once again, thank you for your comments and review.

Have a good remainder of the weekend.

As always,
Dr. Greg
