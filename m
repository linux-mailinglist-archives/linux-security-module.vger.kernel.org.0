To prevent the regression you mentioned, I was suggesting reading the
MOK DB twice.  One time loading all the keys onto the platform keyring.
The other time loading only the CA keys onto the secondary keyring.

But without these requirements, the source of trust is unclear.

Is there a reason why the MOK keyring is temporary?   Asumming a
function similar to "restrict_link_by_builtin_and_secondary_trusted" is
defined to include the MOK keyring, the CA keys in the MOK db would be
loaded onto the MOK keyring, the other keys that meet the secondary
keyring restriction would be loaded directly onto the secondary
keyring[1], and as you currently have, the remaining keys onto the
platform keyring.

This eliminates the exemption needed for loading keys onto the
secondary keyring.  The MOK keyring, containing just CA keys, becomes a
new trust source.

thanks,

Mimi
