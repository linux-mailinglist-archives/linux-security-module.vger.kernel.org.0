Right.  <securityfs>/ima/runtime_measurements_count is defined as the
total number of measurements since boot.  When the measurement list is
carried across kexec, it is the number of measurements since cold boot.

A new securityfs file should be defined for the current number of in
kernel memory records.  Unless the measurement list has been trimmed,
this should be the same as the runtime_measurements_count.

What is being defined here is the first IMA critical-data record, which
really requires some thought.  For ease of review, this new critical-
data record should be a separate patch set from trimming the
measurement list.

As I'm sure you're aware, SElinux defines two critical-data records.  
From security/selinux/ima.c:

        ima_measure_critical_data("selinux", "selinux-state",
                                  state_str, strlen(state_str), false,
                                  NULL, 0);

        ima_measure_critical_data("selinux", "selinux-policy-hash",
                                  policy, policy_len, true,
                                  NULL, 0);
