Ok, there are examples of both passing a file descriptor and passing a
pathname from userspace, but even in the case of passing a pathname,
userspace normally creates the file.

There's been discussion in the past of defining an integrity
capability. Â Are we at that point where we really do need to define an
integrity capability or is everyone comfortable with relying on
CAP_SYS_ADMIN?

When implementing this feature of exporting and truncating the
measurement list, please keep in mind how this would work in the
context of IMA namespaces.

thanks,

Mimi
