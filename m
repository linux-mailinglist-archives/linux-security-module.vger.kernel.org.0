Whether or not Landlock currently blocks security_move_mount()
unconditionally doesn't matter. Introducing this api will have to do it
for the old and the new mount api. First, because we don't implement new
features for the old mount api that aren't also available in the new
mount api. Second, because this asymmetry just begs for bugs when
security_move_mount() isn't blocked anymore.

And third, there seems to be a misconception here.
open_tree(OPEN_TREE_CLONE) gives you an unattached bind-mount.
move_mount() is just sugar on top to attach it to a mount namespace.

But a file descriptor from open_tree(OPEN_TREE_CLONE) can be interacted
with just fine, i.e., read, write, create, shared with other processes.
You could create a bind-mount that is never attached anywhere. So I'm
not sure what security guarantees it would give you to block MS_BIND but
not OPEN_TREE_CLONE.

It should be done for both.

Say /home/hidden is covered by a bind-mount of /dev/null and you're
doing mount --bind /home /somewhere then /home/hidden will be uncovered
(There's cases where the kernel itself fuses mounts together or "locks"
them so things like this cannot happen e.g., when creating an
unprivileged mount namespace.). If your policy blocks unmounting
/home/hidden to protect the underlying file then a non-recursive
bind-mount would be able to circumvent that restriction.
