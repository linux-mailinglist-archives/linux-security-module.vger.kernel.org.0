Thanks for the reply, I now see what you meant. I will try to put something
together (hopefully next week), starting with looking at how we can express
the current LoadPin feature set as a loadable and user-extensible policy, and
then add non-filesystem-related policy entries (like module name restrictions)
to that policy.
