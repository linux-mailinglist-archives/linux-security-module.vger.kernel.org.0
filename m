The measurement list would only need to be paused for the amount of
time it would require to generate the snapshot_aggregate entry, which
should be minimal and only occurs when a privileged userspace requests
a snapshot operation.  The snapshot remains opt-in functionality, and
even then there is the possibility that the kernel could reject the
snapshot request if generating the snapshot_aggregate entry was deemed
too costly (as determined by the kernel) at that point in time.

From my perspective what has been presented is basically just trimming
the in-memory measurement log, the additional complexity (which really
doesn't look that bad IMO) is there to ensure robustness in the face
of an unreliable userspace (processes die, get killed, etc.) and to
establish a new, transitive root of trust in the newly trimmed
in-memory log.

I suppose one could simplify things greatly by having a design where
userspace  captures the measurement log and then writes the number of
measurement records to trim from the start of the measurement log to a
sysfs file and the kernel acts on that.  You could do this with, or
without, the snapshot_aggregate entry concept; in fact that could be
something that was controlled by userspace, e.g. write the number of
lines and a flag to indicate if a snapshot_aggregate was desired to
the sysfs file.  I can't say I've thought it all the way through to
make sure there are no gotchas, but I'm guessing that is about as
simple as one can get.

If there is something else you had in mind, Mimi, please share the
details.  This is a very real problem we are facing and we want to
work to get a solution upstream.
