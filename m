Correct, Landlock domain IDs are used to tie domain creation, denial,
and destruction/drop events (and their use will be extended to user
space in the future).

Yes, only the first LL_DENY (for a domain) emits an LL_DOM_INFO (for
this same domain), which is why this design is interesting: creation of
domains can happen at a high frequency (e.g. script executing a
sandboxed program in a loop, or just build a kernel with sandbox
compilers), and logging every domain creation would make 99% of these
events useless.  See log_status's LANDLOCK_LOG_RECORDED in log_node() in
this patch.

I mean that appending intertwined (i.e. some might be related to define
a domain whereas others might be related to define an object) and
optional (e.g. a file object and a socket object are not defined the
same way) new fields to one message type makes the message less
predictable and more difficult to parse.

That wasn't clear enough, I'll include the previous description in the
next series, but the basic design idea is defined in the cover letter:

Landlock domain creations are a process action.  What we want to log are
the denials and a minimal context (e.g. which task created the related
domain).  I was wondering if we should (right now) include loginuid or
sessionid in this (asynchronous) context.
