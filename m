The cover letter implies that this suggestion is coming from me, which
it definitely is not.  My preference, as I made clear from the very
beginning, is to load ONLY the MOK DB CA keys onto the mok
keyring.   (And even go one step farther, requiring the MOK DB CA
key(s) to be identified on the boot command line.)

Correct, as previously discussed, the other signed MOK DB keys may be
loaded by userspace.   The only reason we're interested in any of the
other MOK DB keys is prevent a regression.  As you previously pointed
out all of the MOK DB keys are currently being loaded onto the platform
keyring.  So leave the existing code, which loads the MOK DB keys onto
the platform keyring, alone to prevent that regression.  It's already
being controlled by a UEFI variable.

Again, my preference would be to load ONLY the MOK DB CA keys onto the
mok keyring.

If YOU decide you want to load the signed keys stored in MOK DB, be my
guest.  However, they should be loaded onto the secondary keyring and a
new restriction defined, similar to
"restrict_link_by_builtin_and_secondary_trusted", which includes mok as
well.

thanks,

Mimi
