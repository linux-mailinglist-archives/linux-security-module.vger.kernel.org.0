Yes, please show us one. I'm fine if the mechanism which allows LKM-based LSMs
cannot be disabled via the kernel configuration options.

I really want a commitment that none of the LSM community objects revival of
LKM-based LSMs. I'm worrying that some of the LSM community objects revival of
LKM-based LSMs because adding extra slots and/or linked list is e.g. an overhead,
increases attack surface etc.

Let's consider the Microsoft Windows operating system. Many security vendors are
offering security software which can run without recompiling the Windows OS.

But what about Linux? Security vendors cannot trivially add a security mechanism
because LKM-based LSMs are not supported since 2.6.24. As a result, some chose
hijacking LSM hooks, and others chose overwriting system call tables.

The Linux kernel is there for providing what the user needs. What about the LSM
infrastructure? The LSM infrastructure is too much evolving towards in-tree and
built-in security mechanisms.

The consequence of such evolving will be "Limited Security Modes" where users cannot
use what they need. New ideas cannot be easily tried if rebuild of vmlinux is
inevitable, which will also prevent a breath of fresh ideas from reaching the LSM
community.

Never "discussed *if* we allow LKM based LSMs", for the LSM community cannot
afford accepting whatever LSMs and the Linux distributors cannot afford enabling
whatever LSMs.

I'm not speaking for the security vendors. I'm speaking from the point of view of
minority/out-of-tree users.

Security is always trial-and-error. Just give all Linux users chances to continue
trial-and-error. You don't need to forbid LKM-based LSMs just because blob management
is not addressed. Please open the LSM infrastructure to anyone.
