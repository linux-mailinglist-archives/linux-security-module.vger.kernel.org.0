At this point in the ongoing process of LSM stacking I'd much rather
we focus on documenting what we know to work and what is known to be
problematic without placing any restrictions on the ordering.  I
believe there are going to be too many "good" combinations to settle
on one single supported ordering; perhaps at some point in the future
we can agree on what that ordering should be, but I think there are
still too many changes in the foreseeable future to settle on an
ordering now.

When I wrote my response I was thinking more of the BPF LSM, any
future LSMs that might be merged upstream, and the myriad of security
requirements admins must meet both now and in the future.

I would argue that if an admin/builder doesn't understand what a shiny
new LSM does, they shouldn't be enabling that shiny new LSM.  Adding
new, potentially restrictive, controls to your kernel build without a
basic understanding of those controls is a recipe for disaster and I
try to avoid recommending disaster as a planned course of action :)
