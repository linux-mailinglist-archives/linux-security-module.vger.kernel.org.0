If you configure audit to record exec() and friends you should have a
proper history of the processes started on the system.

I said "audit and/or TOMOYO"; I believe the "and/or" is important.  If
I recall correctly, and perhaps I misunderstood you, you conceded that
a combination of audit *and/or* TOMOYO would solve this issue.

If you want TOMOYO-like information, run TOMOYO.  If your preferred
distribution doesn't support TOMOYO, you need to either ask them to
support it, find a new distribution that does, or build your own
kernel.

At this point in time, I obviously disagree.

To be very clear, it isn't my duty to persuade Casey about anything
(although if you've followed the LSM stacking saga you know I've
definitely tried on occasion! <g>).  My role here is to maintain the
audit subsystem and LSM layer (along with others which aren't relevant
here) to the best of my ability.  A big part of that is ensuring we
make "smart decisions" with respect to what code we merge as things
like new LSMs and new audit records are things that we have to support
*forever*.  Because of this rather extreme support burden I need to
make sure that we aren't making our jobs (current developers, current
maintainers, and those that will follow us) more difficult than
absolutely necessary.  From my current perspective, the benefits of
this patch, both in terms of unique functionality and durability of
the design/code, are not enough to outweigh the support burden.
