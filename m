No problem, it was as trivial as you said, and I don't think I screwed it up.

I appreciate the heads-up, though, since not only does it mean I don't
get nasty surprises, it also means that I get that warm and fuzzy

Again, this is very much the way to let me know, so that I don't get
that uneasy feeling about anything.

Thanks.
