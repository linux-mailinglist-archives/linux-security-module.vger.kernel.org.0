Question...why do all of these have a ctx_  prefix? Is it possible to trigg=
er=20
an audit context so that the audit machinery collects all of this stuff in=
=20
it's own way? Which means you could drop everything execept op, hook,=20
enforce, rule, and action.

We also have a field dictionary here:
https://github.com/linux-audit/audit-documentation/blob/main/specs/fields/
field-dictionary.csv

which names the known fields and how they should be formatted. If there is =
a=20
collision where they are something else and cannot be in the same format,=20
then we make a new name and hopefully update the dictionary. For example, i=
f=20
you are collecting a process id, use pid and not ctx_pid so that it matches=
 a=20
known definition.

Also, I don't thnk these events can stand on their own. Who did this action=
?=20
You have the pid, but no uid, auid, or session_id.

Hope this helps...
