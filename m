Yes, we agree that the guest needs to manage its own policy.  That's why
we implemented Heki for KVM this way, but without VTLs because KVM
doesn't support them.

To sum up, is the VTL approach the only one that would be acceptable for
KVM?  If yes, that would indeed require a *lot* of work for something
we're not sure will be accepted later on.
