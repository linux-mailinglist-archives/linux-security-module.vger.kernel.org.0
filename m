I might have overlooked something, but if I understands the code 
correctly, we would be copying the same rule over and over again till 
the loop ends in that case. ima_lsm_update_rule() would replace the rule 
node on the rule list without updating the rule in place. Although 
synchronize_rcu() should prevent a UAF, the rule in ima_match_rules() 
would not be updated. Meaning SELinux would always return -ESTALE before 
we copy and retry as we keep passing in the outdated rule entry.
