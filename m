The plan was definitely to not hook everywhere but only call the hooks
that do have a BPF program registered. This was one of the versions
we proposed in the initial patches where the call to the BPF LSM was
guarded by a static key with it being enabled only when there's a
BPF program attached to the hook.

https://lore.kernel.org/bpf/20200220175250.10795-5-kpsingh@chromium.org/

However, this special-cased BPF in the LSM framework, and, was met
with opposition. Our plan is to still achieve this, but we want to do this
with DEFINE_STATIC_CALL patches:

https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/cover.1547073843.git.jpoimboe@redhat.com

Using these, only can we enable the call into the hook based on whether
a program is attached, we can also eliminate the indirect call overhead which
currently affects the "slow" way which was decided in the discussion:

https://lore.kernel.org/bpf/202002241136.C4F9F7DFF@keescook/

I am not sure if limiting the hooks is required here once we have
the ability to call into BPF only when a program is attached. If the
the user provides a BPF program, deliberately returns 0 (or any
other value) then it is working as intended. Even if we limit this in the
bpf LSM, deliberate privileged users can still achieve this with
other means.
