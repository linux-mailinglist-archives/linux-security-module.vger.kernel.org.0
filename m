I am enabling both in my patch since a person can turn around and use =
the other syscall by=20
simply compressing their module.  Now their module is verified by a =
different keyring.=20
Other than completely disabling the init_module syscall, which we =
don=E2=80=99t do, there is nothing=20
preventing them from doing that.  We have one kernel config per =
architecture. We build
and sign the modules with an appended signature.

I can not predict all the ways someone will use a kernel built from this =
single config. =20
I do believe if someone has IMA working with module verification and =
appended signatures,
some are not going to understand why their module that was compressed =
and loading=20
(via syscall init_module) suddenly fails to load (via syscall =
finit_module) once they=20
uncompress it. =20
