This RFC contained the FS code.  In size terms its very comparable to
your ioctl.

Enumeration looks to be problematic with your interface ... what are
you supposed to do, keep calling ACPI_SVKL_GET_KEY_INFO on an advancing
index until it gives you an error and then try to work out what key
you're interested in by one of its numeric properties?

I think a GUIDed structure actually helps here because we don't have to
have someone assign, say, u16 types to keys we're interested in and the
filesystem does all the enumeration for us.  It also means new use
cases can simply expand the properties without waiting for any
internals to catch up.
