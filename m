Right, I see what you're saying, especially with the "additional access
rules for other scopes" example, and I think I'm happy with this.  I guess
my attempt at trying to make the API more "elegant" would introduce
complexity and also create future inconsistency if other existing scope
bits are combined with handled_access rules.

I ended up being pretty busy today but I can definitely send the next
version tomorrow with your formatting changes and comments.  I'm happy
with it going into the next merge window if you are.  Justin raises a
point about having these two mechanisms in the same ABI version - see
below for consideration.

I'm not sure I fully understand the complexity here, but I think, assuming
these land in separate kernel versions, it will have to be that if both
the scope bit and LANDLOCK_ACCESS_FS_RESOLVE_UNIX is requested (maybe if
the user actually adds rules containing RESOLVE_UNIX access), but only the
scope bit is supported, then it will have to skip enforcing pathname UNIX
socket restrictions altogether by skipping both the scope bit and the
RESOLVE_UNIX access (if in best effort mode), or fail (if in hard
requirement mode).

I don't immediately see how further customization ability (e.g. synthetic
access rights or other AND/OR combination) could be used - if an app needs
access to a privileged socket and can't pre-open it before
landlock_restrict_self(), then the only realistic choice is to not use the
scope bits if LANDLOCK_ACCESS_FS_RESOLVE_UNIX is not supported.

Given that the scope bit and RESOLVE_UNIX access right are in some sense
part of the same system (they interact in an OR manner, after all), there
is some positive for having them introduced in the same version, but on
the other hand, with my above reasoning, I don't think these two
mechanisms (scope bit and RESOLVE_UNIX access) being in different ABI
versions would be too much of a problem.  In either case, for applications
which require access to more "privileged" sockets, when running on a
kernel without the RESOLVE_UNIX access right support, no pathname socket
restrictions can be applied (i.e. it won't use the scope bit either, there
isn't much "compromise" it can make here).  On the other hand, if
RESOLVE_UNIX is supported, then it knows that the scope bit is also
supported, and can just use it.

Furthermore, an application / Landlock config etc can always opt to not
use the scope bit at all, if it "knows" all the locations where the
application's sockets would be placed, and just use RESOLVE_UNIX access
right (or nothing if it is not supported).

(The following is a bit of a side note, not terribly relevant if we're
deciding to go with the patch as is.)

In this "allow same-scope connect unconditionally" proposal, the
application would still be able to (bind to and) connect to its own
sockets, even if LANDLOCK_ACCESS_FS_RESOLVE_UNIX is handled and nothing is
allowed to have LANDLOCK_ACCESS_FS_RESOLVE_UNIX access.  But a sandboxer
which for whatever reason doesn't want this "allow same scope" default can
still prevent the use of (pathname) sockets by restricting
LANDLOCK_ACCESS_FS_MAKE_SOCK, because if an app can't connect to any
sockets it doesn't own, and can't create any sockets itself either, then
it effectively can't connect to any sockets at all.

(Although on second thought, I guess there could be a case where an app
first creates some socket files before doing landlock_restrict_self(),
then it might still be able to bind to these even without
LANDLOCK_ACCESS_FS_MAKE_SOCK?)
