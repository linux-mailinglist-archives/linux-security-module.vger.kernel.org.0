Ok, I amended this part for v2 to hopefully better express what I'm
alluding to. I also added a paragraph about the routers dropping
packets with IP options, which explains the motivation better, anyway.

I tried to test what you describe - hopefully I got close enough:

My test setup has 3 VMs (running Fedora 39 from the stock qcow2 image)
A, B, and R, connected via separate links as A <--> R <--> B, where R
acts as a router between A and B (net.ipv4.ip_forward is set to 1 on
R, and the appropriate routes are set on A, B, R).

The A <--> R link has subnet 10.123.123.0/24, A having address
10.123.123.2 and R having 10.123.123.1.
The B <--> R link has subnet 10.123.124.0/24, B having address
10.123.124.2 and R having 10.123.124.1.

The links are implemented as GRE tunnels over the main network that is
shared between the VMs.

Netlabel configuration on A:
netlabelctl cipsov4 add pass doi:16 tags:5
netlabelctl map del default
netlabelctl map add default address:0.0.0.0/0 protocol:unlbl
netlabelctl map add default address:::/0 protocol:unlbl
netlabelctl map add default address:10.123.123.0/24 protocol:cipsov4,16
netlabelctl map add default address:10.123.124.0/24 protocol:cipsov4,16

Netlabel configuration on R:
netlabelctl cipsov4 add pass doi:16 tags:5
netlabelctl map del default
netlabelctl map add default address:0.0.0.0/0 protocol:unlbl
netlabelctl map add default address:::/0 protocol:unlbl
netlabelctl map add default address:10.123.123.0/24 protocol:cipsov4,16

B has no netlabel configured.

(I.e. A tries to send CIPSO-labeled packets to B, but R treats the
10.123.124.0/24 network as unlabeled, so should strip/add the CIPSO
label when forwarding between A and B.)

A basic TCP connection worked just fine in both directions with and
without these patches applied (I installed the patched kernel on all
machines, though it should only matter on machine R). I ignored the
actual labels/CIPSO content - i.e. I didn't change the default SELinux
policy and put SELinux into permissive mode on machines A and R.

Capturing the packets on R showed the following IP option content
without the patches:
A -> R: CIPSO
R -> B: NOPs
B -> R: (empty)
R -> A: CIPSO

With the patches this changed to:
A -> R: CIPSO
R -> B: (empty)
B -> R: (empty)
R -> A: CIPSO

Is this convincing enough or do you have different scenarios in mind?
