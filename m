As previously said on v1,
   This design seems overly complex and requires synchronization between the
   "snapshot" record and exporting the records from the measurement list. [...] 

   Concerns:
   - Pausing extending the measurement list.

Nothing has changed in terms of the complexity or in terms of pausing
the measurement list.   Pausing the measurement list is a non starter.

Userspace can already export the IMA measurement list(s) via the
securityfs {ascii,binary}_runtime_measurements file(s) and do whatever
it wants with it.  All that is missing in the kernel is the ability to
trim the measurement list, which doesn't seem all that complicated.
