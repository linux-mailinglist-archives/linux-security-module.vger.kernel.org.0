Most of this can be added, if we really need to. Ability to revoke BPF
token is easy to implement (though of course it will apply only for
subsequent operations). We can allocate ID for BPF token just like we
do for BPF prog/map/link and let tools iterate and fetch information
about it. As for controlling who's passing what and where, I don't
think the situation is different for any other FD-based mechanism. You
might as well create a BPF map/prog/link, pass it through SCM_RIGHTS
or BPF FS, and that application can keep doing the same to other
processes.

Ultimately, currently we have root permissions for applications that
need BPF. That's already very dangerous. But just because something
might be misused or abused doesn't prevent us from making a good
practical use of it, right?

Also, there is LSM on top of all of this to override and control how
the BPF subsystem is used, regardless of BPF token. It can override
any of the privileges mechanism, capabilities, BPF token, whatnot.

It's explicitly what we *do not* want to do, as it is a major problem
and logistical complication. Every single application will have to be
rewritten to use such a special daemon/service and its API, which is
completely different from bpf() syscall API. It invalidates the use of
all the libbpf (and other bpf libraries') APIs, BPF skeleton is
incompatible with this. It's a nightmare. I've got feedback from
people in another company that do have BPF service with just a tiny
subset of BPF functionality delegated to such service, and it's a pain
and definitely not a preferred way to do things.

Just think about having to mirror a big chunk of bpf() syscall as an
RPC. So no, BPF proxy is definitely not a good solution.

All this could and should be done through LSM in much more decoupled
and transparent (to application) way. BPF token doesn't prevent this.
It actually helps with this, because organizations can actually
dictate that operations that do not provide BPF token are
automatically rejected, and those that do provide BPF token can be
further checked and granted or rejected based on specific BPF token
instance.
