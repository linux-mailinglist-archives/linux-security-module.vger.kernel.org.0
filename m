Confused. If use of BPF is a problem, use of BPF-LSM is also a problem?
If one were able to implement security modules using BPF-LSM, such modules
are headache for distributors? If so, BPF based LSM modules can't be a
candidate for replacing C based LSM modules...

More we want to enforce protecting with module signing, more we need to make
whatever code built-in and run in the kernel space. Upstream-first pressure
will push whatever code for inclusion into the upstream kernel.

What does "it" referring to? Fedora has chosen not to build TOMOYO into Fedora's
vmlinux. But I haven't heard from Fedora that Fedora won't ship tomoyo.ko as a
separate package.

How is tomoyo.ko connected to loading of out-of-tree code? If the module signing
can prevent unsigned modules from loading, where is the possibility of loading
unsigned LSM modules even if LSM hooks are exported to loadable modules?

 From module signing perspective, there will be no difference between the LSM
framework exports LSM hooks and TOMOYO exports LSM hooks. And
https://lkml.kernel.org/r/caafb609-8bef-4840-a080-81537356fc60@I-love.SAKURA.ne.jp
leaves the choice available to distro users. Why not acceptable?

By some chance..., can't module signing prevent any code (both in-tree and
out-of-tree) that is not signed from loading !?
