Right.  IIUC, even in your patch, the file could be renamed
while LSM is checking the path, no ?  I think holding the
path ref does not lock concurrent rename operations.

To me, it's not a small race and basically it's the same with
the ops below,

sk1.bind('test')
sk1.listen()
os.rename('test', 'test2')
sk2.connect('test2')

sk1.bind('test')
sk1.listen()
sk2.connect('test1')
os.rename('test', 'test2')

and the important part is whether the path _was_ the
allowed one when LSM checked the path.

Imagine that the rename ops was done a bit earlier, which is
before the first lookup in unix_find_bsd().  Then, the socket
will not be found, and -ECONNREFUSED is returned.
LSM pcan pretend as such.

Do you mean that the evaluation of the stacked LSMs could
return 0 if one of them allows it even though other LSMs deny ?

Note that connected DGRAM socket can send() data to other sockets
by specifying the peer name in each send(), and even they can
disconnect by connect(AF_UNSPEC).
