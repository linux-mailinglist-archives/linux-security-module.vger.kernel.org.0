Typically the label is used for access control decisions. But processes have 
other attributes such as a list of open files. I think adding this information 
will be useful - I'm not opposed to the idea. I am just thinking about how to 
present the information where it is more useful.

I do not read that mail list. AUDIT_PROC_HIST or AUDIT_PROC_CHAIN or some 
thing like that would be the better way to go. If someone wanted to see if 
they have process history for a segfault, how would they do it with the 
proposed record?

ausearch --subject sshd

That just doesn't seem right. If you had a record dedicated to this 
information, then you can do:

ausearch -m PROC_HIST

and it would give you that information. And if you had the data split up 
like: p[0]=xx p[1]=xx p[2]=yy

Then  someone could do this to make a report specific to this:

import auparser as aup
au = aup.AuParser(aup.AUSOURCE_FILE, "audit.log")

au.search_add_expression("type r= PROC_HIST", aup.AUSEARCH_RULE_CLEAR)
au.search_set_stop(aup.AUSEARCH_STOP_RECORD)
while au.search_next_event():
    print("Call chain: ", end="")
    while True:
        print(au.interpret_field(), end = "")
        if au.next_field() == False:
            break
        print("->", end="")

au = None
sys.exit(0)

This would be more programmer friendly.
