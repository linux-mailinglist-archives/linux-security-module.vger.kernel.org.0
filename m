Let me try to summarize 'b'.  The initial unsupported hash algorithms would
continue to be unsupported in subsequent kexec's.  However this does not ad=
dress
the case where the initial kernel image supported a hash algorithm, but the
subsequent kexec'ed image does not.  The TPM bank has already been extended=
 with
other values.  In this case, like the original violation the attestation se=
rvice
would not verify.  If I'm understanding it correctly, 'b' is thus a partial
solution.

My concern with 'b' is the ability to read the multiple TPM bank PCRs so ea=
rly
during kernel initialization.  Will it succeed?  If it does succeed, will i=
t
introduce initialization delays?

FYI, because the IMA Kconfig selects SHA1, we're guaranteed that SHA1 exist=
s in
the kernel and the subsequent kexec'ed kernel.  For this reason we're guara=
nteed
that the measurement list is complete.  The simplest solution, not necessar=
ily
the best, would be to punt the problem for the time being by replacing the
"select" with a different hash algorithm.

I just realized that unlike the existing open-writers/ToMToU violations, by
definition the new unsupported bank violation would not be included in the
measurement list, but just extended into the TPM.
