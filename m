Wait, why would you not have to document your new files no matter what?
That should not be an issue either way.

You create that yourself, just like tracefs does, and set the standard
right away, not an issue.

Enabling it does take time, which is good because if they do not think
it should be present because they do not want to use it, then it will
not be, which means either they do not need your new feature, or you
have not made it useful enough.

So again, not an issue.
And you can even mount it yourself from the kernel if you insist on it
always being present.

The issue is that random things gets added to those filesystems,
exposing stuff that perhaps some systems do NOT want exposed to
userspace.  Making it explicit as to what they have to mount to get
access to that is a good thing because you have less of an "attack
surface" and all of that.

So again, this should not be an issue.  If coco stuff is so important
that people need it, then having them have to add it to their init
scripts just to mount the filesystem is not an issue as there are other
userspace components of all of this mess that they had to install
anyway.  Just make it part of the userspace tools that are going to be
accessing these files because you have to get those onto the systems no
matter what.
