Thanks for pointing this out, Iurii, that actually looks pretty cool.
I still personally prefer keeping tests and code separate, but if we
decide to go the route of mixing tests and code, maybe we might want
to use this as a model.

So I think this is a very subtle point which is very widely
misunderstood. Most people write code and then write their tests,
following this practice along with only testing public interfaces
often causes people to just not test all of their code, which is
wrong.

The idea of only testing public interfaces is supposed to make people
think more carefully about what the composite layers of the program
is. If you are having difficulty getting decent coverage by only
testing your public interfaces, then it likely tells you that you have
one of two problems:

1) You have code that you don't need, and you should remove it.

2) One of the layers in your program is too think, and you should
introduce a new layer with a new public interface that you can test
through.

I think the second point here is problematic with how C is written in
the kernel. We don't really have any concept of public vs. private
inside the kernel outside of static vs. not static, which is much more
restricted.
