Correct, if this patch is merged it must be backported too, but there
might be better alternatives, or we might just stick to the initial
approach.

Indeed, because the socket is created before the sandboxing, the socket
could be reused to bind (or connect) to other ports.  This is a good
example of why using current's instead of socket's credentials may be
less surprising.  From my point of view, the main issue is that a socket
can be reconfigured.

According to sock_alloc_file(), the newly created socket inherits the
caller's credentials, which is similar to a call to openat2(2) with a
directory file descriptor.

Yes, that's why it might be more risky, but I wanted to have this
discussion.  Whatever the outcome, it should be explained in
Documentation/security/landlock.rst

One thing to keep in mind and that contrary to other LSMs, Landlock,
like seccomp, enables processes to (only) drop privileges, and this is
done by the process itself (not at execve time).  This was also one
argument for the initial approach.

A thing that bothered me was related to the restrictions of sockets,
especially with the WIP scoping feature.  Datagram (unix) sockets could
work before sandboxing, and suddenly become broken after sandboxing
(because the security check would be done at send time instead of
connect time).  This kind of issue should be identified quite early and
easily though.

However, there is still an inconsistency between connected stream
sockets and datagram sockets.  From a security point of view, this looks
like a good thing though.

Right, I think it's too complex for users.

Good point.  That's another argument for the initial approach and the
way you sandboxed the example: dropping the *_TCP access rights, it is
not possible to rebind or reconnect a socket (to another address).

Actually, I'm not sure if using the socket's credential would not
confuse users to understand why an access is denied (or allowed).

We could also add a new "scope" for socket reconfiguration of sockets
created by a parent or sibling domain, similar to the ptrace
restrictions.

I see other alternatives:

- We could have a new ruleset's attribute to specify if network
  restrictions should apply on the caller or the socket.  That might be
  confusing for users though.

- We could just stick to the initial approach and add new access rights
  (denied by default, similar to FS_REFER) that will only apply to newly
  created sockets.  This is close to the previous alternative but more
  explicit. Both use cases could then be used, with a default secure
  approach (i.e. the initial one).  However, we need to have a clear
  rationale for the WIP scoping restrictions: should the caller or the
  socket be checked as the client?

- We could extend the current approach and check both the caller's
  credential and the socket's credential.  This could be confusing to
  users though.

- We could have a new fcntl(2) command to (securely) transition a file
  descriptor's credential to the caller's one (e.g. approved by
  ptrace_may_access).  That could be generic to all Linux access control
  systems.

- According to a new ruleset's attribute, we could revalidate (at use
  time) file descriptors not opened by the caller's Landlock domain, but
  users would have to be explicit (e.g. stdio issue). And how to handle
  partially allowed accesses?
