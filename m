Thanks for these patches and the related benchmarks!

I think a dedicated struct landlock_domain has value: clearer API,
smaller domain's size, optimizations.  In the current implementation of
the hash table, the domain's size increases in most cases because of the
table's size.  We also still have scattered rules and at least two
pointer dereferencing (if no hash collision): landlock_hashtable.hlist,
and hlist_node.first.  This could be avoided with a compact flat
structure, using a hash table or just an array with sorted keys.  See a
new proposal in my reply to patch 2.
