Apologies for being blunt, but  the token approach to me seems to be a 
work around providing the right level/classification for a pod/container 
in order to say you support unprivileged containers using eBPF. I think 
if your container needs to do privileged things it should have and be 
classified with the right permissions (privileges) to do what it needs 
to do.

The  proxy BPF on behalf of the container approach works for containers 
that don't need to do privileged BPF operations.

I have to say that  the `proxy BPF on behalf of the container` meets the 
needs of unprivileged pods and at the same time giving CAP_BPF to the 
applications meets the needs of these PODs that need to do 
privileged/bpf things without any tokens. Ultimately you are trusting 
these apps in the same way as if you were granting a token.
