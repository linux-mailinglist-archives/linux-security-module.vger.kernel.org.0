I read it.

Maybe you have dismissed the PCR update counter already...
I am not sure what the PCR update counter is supposed to help with. It won't allow you to detect
missing log events but rather will confuse anyone looking at it when my application extends PCR 12
for example, which also affects the update counter. It's a global counter that increases with every
PCR extension (except PCR 16, 21, 22, 23) and if used as proposed would prevent any application from
extending PCRs.

The shards should will need to be written into some sort of standard location or a config file needs to
be defined, so that everyone knows where to find them and how they are named.

PCR quote or 'quotes'? Why multiple?

Form your proposal but you may have changed your opinion  following what I see in other messages:
"- The Kernel will get the current TPM PCR values and PCR update counter [2]
    and store them as template data in a new IMA event "snapshot_aggregate"."

Afaik TPM quote's don't give you the state of the individual PCR values, therefore
I would expect to at least find the 'PCR values' of all the PCRs that IMA touched to
be in the snapshot_aggregate so I can replay all the following events on top of these
PCR values and come up with the values that were used in the "final PCR quote". This
is unless you expect the server to take an automatic snapshot of the values of the
PCRs  that it computed while evaluating the log in case it ever needs to go back.

For anything regarding determining the 'trustworthiness of a system' one would have to
be able to go back to the very beginning of the log *or* remember in what state a
system was when the latest snapshot was taken so that if a restart happens it can resume
with that assumption about state of trustworthiness and know what the values of the PCRs
were at that time so it can resume replaying the log (or the server would get these
values from the log).

The AK quotes by the kernel (which adds a 2nd AK key) that James is proposing
could be useful if the entire log, consisting of multiple shards, is very large and
cannot be transferred from the client to the server in one go so that the server could
evaluate the 'final PCR quote' immediately . However, if a client can indicated 'I will
send more the next time and I have this much more to transfer' and the server allows
this multiple times (until all the 1MB shards of the 20MB log are transferred) then that
kernel AK key would not be necessary since presumably the "final PCR quote", created
by a user space client, would resolve whether the entire log is trustworthy.

I thought maybe 'golden PCR values'... because those let me replay PCR extensions from
a previous point.

Can you give a reason for this? You mean the state doesn't need to be remembered for client
devices whose log hasn't been truncated?

Yes, this must be possible.
