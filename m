Not quite. The snapshot aggregate still has a purpose, which is to stitch
together the snapshots on the disk and the in-memory segment of the IMA
log. The specific details are in the RFC Section D.1, quoted here:

The "snapshot_aggregate" marker provides the following benefits:

a. It facilitates the IMA log to be divided into multiple chunks and
provides mechanism to verify the integrity of the system using only the
latest chunks during remote attestation.

b. It provides tangible evidence from Kernel to the attestation client
that IMA log snapshotting has been enabled and at least one snapshot
exists on the system.

c. It helps both the Kernel and UM attestation client define clear
boundaries between multiple snapshots.

d. In the event of multiple snapshots, the last measured
"snapshot_aggregate" marker, which is present in the current segment of
the IMA log, has sufficient information to verify the integrity of the
IMA log segment as well as the previous snapshots using the PCR quotes.

e. In the event of multiple snapshots, say N, if the remote-attestation
service has already processed the last N-1 snapshots, it can efficiently
parse through them by just processing "snapshot_aggregate" events to
compute the PCR quotes needed to verify the events in the last snapshot.
This should drastically improve the IMA log processing efficiency of
the service.

I disagree with this.  Redundancy is a moot point because
"snapshot_aggregate" is required for the points mentioned above.
