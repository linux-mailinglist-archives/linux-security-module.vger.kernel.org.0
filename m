Well, the EK doesn't need to be part of the log: it's just a permanent
part of the TPM identity.  To verify the log, you need access to the
TPM that was used to create it, so that's the point at which you get
the EK.

An AK is simply a TPM generated signing key (meaning the private part
of the key is secured by the TPM and known to no-one else).  In the
literature a TPM generated signing key doesn't become an Attestation
Key until it's been verified using an EK property (either a certify for
a signing EK or a make/activate credential round trip for the more
usual encryption EK.

So the proposal is for each quote that's used to verify a log shard is
that the TPM simply generate a random signing key and use that to sign
the quote.  You need to save the TPM form of the generated key so it
can be loaded later and the reason for that is you can do the EK
verification at any time after the quote was given by loading the saved
key and running the verification protocol.  In the normal attestation
you do the EK verification of the AK *before* the quote, but there's no
property of the quote that depends on this precedence provided you do
the quote with a TPM generated signing key.

The underlying point is that the usual way an EK verifies an AK
requires a remote observer, which the kernel won't have, so the kernel
must do all its stuff locally (generate key, get quote) and then at
some point later the system can become remote connected and prove to
whatever external entity that the log shard is valid.  So we have to
have all the components necessary for that proof: the log shard, the
quote and the TPM form of the AK.

Right, but if you're sharding a log, the kernel doesn't know if a
verifier has been in contact yet.  The point of the protocol above is
to make that not matter.  The verifier can contact the system after the
log has been saved and the verification will still work.

Only if the system is currently in contact with the verifier and the
verifier has created the AK.  That may not have happened.

Yes, but I was assuming tampering with or discarding the log file would
be treated in exactly the same way as an in-kernel IMA log tamper.
