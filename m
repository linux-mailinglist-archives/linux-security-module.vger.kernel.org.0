Yeah, this should be OK in theory but it might be confusing to
developers.

Yes, that's the main idea.  The synthetic access right would just be
useful to avoid doing this check each time but let the library do it
instead.  Anyway, that's mostly a (Rust) lib thing.

That's good to keep in mind.  There might be weird cases but developers
should be encouraged to set all the scopes bits and then potentially
allow specific sockets with FS_RESOLVE_UNIX.
