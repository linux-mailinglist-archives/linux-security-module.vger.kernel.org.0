Either way - I'd say if you have time to do it, please do! Probably just
include the REQ_F_CREDS change too. FWIW, I'd add that in
io_uring/openclose.c:io_install_fixed_fd_prep() - just check for
REQ_F_CREDS in there and return -EPERM (I think that would be
appropriate?) and that should disallow any IORING_OP_FIXED_FD_INSTALL if
creds have been reassigned.

If there are any concerns, then I say let's just explicitly disable it
rather than rely on maybe something in the security checking catching
it. Especially because I don't think there's a valid use case for doing
this, other than perhaps trying to bypass checks you'd normally hit.
Better to err on the side of caution then.

See above for a HOWTO, if in doubt.

Thanks for looking into this!
