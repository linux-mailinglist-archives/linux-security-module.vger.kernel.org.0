Tetsuo, just in case there is any doubt in your mind, I agree with
Kees' comments above and I reaffirm my previous statement about LSM ID
guarantees.

As far as I can tell this RFC isn't really about dynamically loadable
LSMs, it's about blocking the LSM syscall work, specifically the LSM
ID tokens.  As I've said many times before, the LSM ID concept is
moving forward and if you can't respect that decision, at least stop
wasting our time.
