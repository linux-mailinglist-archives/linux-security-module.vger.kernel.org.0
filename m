Thanks Günther!  This feature is indeed very important to be able to
enforce consistent sandboxing.

We should assume that there is not security boundaries between threads,
but we should also minimize inconsistent results.  So, no, we should not
grant any particular privileges/capabilites to other threads but only
drop them in a least surprising way for users.  See my proposal in reply
to the first patch.

The issue with Landlock also exists with PR_SET_NO_NEW_PRIVS, so we need
to be able to synchronize both properties (as already possible with
seccomp).

I think it's the right approach, but the difficult part is handling
errors in a safe and consistent way.

Most of the single-threaded code can be reused.

We should follow seccomp's footsteps as much as possible.
