Thanks for the update Micah.

Generally speaking, serving as a maintainer requires checking email on
a regular basis.  There isn't a well defined requirement that I'm
aware of, but once every couple months, or even once a month, is
outside what many expect, myself included.  I know you have moved on
from ChromeOS, but do you have a personal desire to continue
maintaining SafeSetID?  Linux has a rich history of maintainers who
maintain subsystems outside of a paying job, and I would be happy to
support you in such a role, but in order to do so I think you would
need to check your email at least once a week.  However, if you aren't
able to commit to that at this point in time we probably should mark
SafeSetID as being in the "Orphan" state, with patches accepted via
the LSM tree until a suitable maintainer can be found.
