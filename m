Sorry for misleading you. My mistake, I should have checked the thread
first instead of relying on my memory.

Am I correct in understanding that any proposals and questions I'd
like to discuss with the maintainers and the community should start
with patches? Even if the goal isn't to implement a change right away,
but merely to evaluate the idea.

When I proposed the prototype, it seemed excessive to me to prepare
patches for something that could be "finished" at the idea stage.
