Hello,

It has been reported to me that read/write syscalls on a pipe created
via the pipe(2) family of syscalls spend a large percentage of time in
avc_lookup() via selinux_file_permission(). This is specific to pipes
(and also accept(2)'d sockets, I think) because these pipe fds are
created using alloc_file_pseudo() as opposed to do_dentry_open(),
which means that the security_file_open() hook is never called on
them.

In SELinux, this means that in selinux_file_permission() the
read/write permission is always revalidated, leading to suboptimal
performance, because SELinux re-checks the read/write perms of an open
file only if the subject/target label or policy is different from when
these permissions were checked during selinux_file_open().

So I decided to try and see what would happen if I add a
security_file_open() call to alloc_file(). This worked well for pipes
- all domains that call pipe(2) seem to already have the necessary
permissions to pass the open check, at least in Fedora policy - but I
got lots of denials from accept(2), which also calls alloc_file()
under the hood to create the new socket fd. The problem there is that
programs usually call only recvmsg(2)/sendmsg(2) on fds returned by
accept(2), thereby avoiding read/write checks on sock_file, which
means that the domains don't normally have such permissions. Only
programs that open actual socket files on the filesystem would
unavoidably need read/write (or so I think), yet they wouldn't need
them for the subsequent recvmsg(2)/sendmsg(2) calls.

So I'm wondering if anyone has any idea how this could be fixed
(optimized) without introducing regressions or awkward exceptions in
the code. At this point, I don't see any way to do it regression-free
without either adding a new hook or changing security_file_open() to
distinguish between do_dentry_open() and alloc_file() + calling it
from both places...
