Agree with your point about TPM PCR update counter Stefan.
I will bring it up in the update counter patch series discussion [1].

We thought about well known standard location earlier.
Letting the Kernel choose the name/location of the snapshot
file comes with its own complexity. Our initial stance is we don’t
want to handle that at Kernel level, and let the UM client choose
the location/naming of the snapshot files. But we are happy to
reconsider if the community requests it.

I meant a single set of PCR values captured when snapshot_aggregate
is logged. Sorry for the confusion.

Correct. We intend to support the above. I hope our proposal
description captures it. BTW, when you say ‘restart’, you mean the UM
process restart, right? Because in case of a Kernel restart
(i.e. cold-boot) the past IMA log (and the TPM state) is lost,
and old snapshots (if any) are useless.

I meant it doesn’t have to be remembered for each individual
client device. Majority of the client devices will be in one of the few
golden-PCR-states when the snapshots are captured.
