Different users could have different and conflicting requirements, and
we would spend time trying to conciliate those. We can avoid that by
doing it the same for everyone, and the additional cost of handling it
I believe it is fair.

I could accept staging N entries since I already agreed with Gregory
and Steven, and since it requires only an extra iteration in the linked
list. The other desired functionality should be implemented in user
space.

It could be a single location, the user space program would be
responsible to present the IMA measurement list as if it was never
trimmed.
