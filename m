In which case it would seem that this isn't something we could
restrict on the grounds of integrity.  Regardless, thanks for
mentioning it.

Sorry, my apologies, most of my interactions with the lockdown LSM
have focused on the enforcement side and not the userspace API in
securityfs; while lockdown has multiple different levels/reasons, for
some reason only three are actually available to userspace.  I'm
guessing that the ordering of levels beyond the basic
none/integrity/confidentiality values is an area of debate and it is
easier to offer a limited number of options.

I'm also concerned about the difference between test and production
and the potential for "special" test configurations making their way
into production systems, this is why I'm not in favor of special
configurations which are only enabled for testing.  I also have
concerns about testing "special" configurations as opposed to what
people actually run.
