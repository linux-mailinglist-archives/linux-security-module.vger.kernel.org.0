Sure, no problem. I'll add a bit more detail to the Kconfig in v3, 
something
like:

"""
This option enables the Integrity Policy Enforcement subsystem
allowing systems to enforce integrity requirements on user land
binaries. IPE differs from other LSMs by removing dependencies
on filesystem metadata, making its decisions based off of kernel-
resident features and data structures. A key feature of IPE is a
customizable policy to allow admins to reconfigure integrity
requirements on the fly.

Yeah, that's a fair point. I had originally based _all_ of these audit
functions off of common_lsm_audit which utilizes these two flags.
We chose not to use that specific function for several reasons, but
there's no reason to keep these allocator flags. I'll move it to
GFP_KERNEL.

Fair point. I wanted to collapse as much of the *common* user-facing 
strings
into one file, and I was trying to adhere to the 80-character limit.

I'll remove the function and inline it.

Yep. I'll fix it in v3. Same with ipe_audit_policy_activation, below. 
The only one
that runs in non-sleepable context is ipe_audit_match.

Well, this is embarrassing. This is supposed to be the argument, cache,
not the variable, cache. The variable shadowing does indeed do what you
describe.

This didn't come up in any of my testing because none of the
properties introduced in this patch series utilize the cache. It's kept in
to facilitate the storage of potentially expensive operations.

I'm just going to cut out all of this code. It'll be re-added
if something actually needs it.

This variable is set by an auto-generated file, invoked by the tool created

I'm not sure why locking is necessary on this structure? This structure is
only added to, synchronously, at lsm_init. The first time it's queried 
after
that is core_init with ipe_securityfs_init. Every subsequent time is when
user mode is setup and 1.) IPE is evaluating a binary, or 2.) IPE is 
loading
a policy. We don't support the run time loading of properties, nor do we
support the removal of policies, so the tree should be stable without locks?

Thanks, I'll strip the header comments.

Easily fixed by adding a \n to pr_fmt. Will be fixed in next iteration.

This is my inexperience with rcu. I recognize statically allocated 
variables
are zero-initialized, however, I thought that the rcu system needed to set
things up with the pointer through this method before it can be used.
I'll remove it.

Ah, this is great! It's not a problem with the sysctls being set too 
late - the
enforce and success_audit sysctls only come into play once user land is 
setup
after kernel boot,

I'll add the prefixes. Thanks.
