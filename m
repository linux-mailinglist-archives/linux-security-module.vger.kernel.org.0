Measured boot protects you against that, as I explained: what we do in
our model is lock the full disk encryption to a key in the TPM that
enforces an local attestation policy: only if a all measurements match
that policy the FDE key is released to the OS. Hence yes, if SB is off
*any* code can run, but if it's not the right code then it cannot
unlock the disk. If it *is* able to unlock the FDE however, then this
is proof that the boot chain is in order, and hence the kernel can be
trusted, and it makes sense for it to defend itself from later steps.

Having an option for this would be better than nothing of course, but
I seriously wonder what the value of the check is supposed to be at
all. SecureBoot=off tells the system: hey, please accept any boot-time
resource without validation, and firmware and boot loaders honour that,
but Linux then does the opposite, invents some artificial checks not
even done if SB is on!

I mean, a boot trust chain means: trust what comes before, and
authenticate/measure what comes next before you pass control to it.

But for some reason Linux makes up a different model, where if told to
not authenticate it suddenly doesn't trust half of what comes before
anymore, but the other half it does. And that's just bogus, and
illogical.
