Without looking at the patchset in any detail yet, I wanted to point
out that we do have some documented guidelines for adding new LSM
hooks:

https://github.com/LinuxSecurityModule/kernel/blob/main/README.md#new-lsm-h=
ook-guidelines

I just learned that there are provisions for adding this to the
MAINTAINERS file, I'll be doing that shortly.  My apologies for not
having it in there sooner.
