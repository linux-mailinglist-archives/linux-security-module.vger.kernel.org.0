You're basically relying on trusted/verified boot and, in TPM 1.2 terminolo=
gy,
sealing a key to a TPM PCR value.  Only if the PCR matches an expected valu=
e is
the key released.  Instead of relying on MOK, the keys could be stored in t=
he
TPM NVRAM and loaded onto the existing .machine keyring or define a new key=
ring
linked to the .secondary_trusted_keys keyring[1].  Then you could really cl=
aim
the TPM as a new root of trust for both trusted and secure boot without any
dependency on MOK.
                                                                           =
    =20
That would be preferable to changing the existing expectations to loading t=
he
MOK keys when secure boot is not enabled.       =20
                                                                           =
