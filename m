SHASH_DESC_ON_STACK() uses at least 512 bytes of stack
everywhere, which is half of the warning limit for a function on
32 bit kernels.

With KASAN, a small redzone is put around it so we can detect out
of bounds access to a variable that is passed by reference.
clang makes that buffer larger than gcc, so we end up with something
like 768 bytes for each instance of SHASH_DESC_ON_STACK().

Most other users still stay below the 1024 byte warning level though,
because typical functions only use a few bytes of stack space.
In case of ima_calc_field_array_hash_tfm(), the is also the buffer[]
array of 255 bytes that gets another large redzone.

I fixed up all the (randconfig) warnings I get for arm32, arm64 and
x86 kernels, and I think there were four to five that were because of
SHASH_DESC_ON_STACK(). It might make sense to convert all
three instances in ima to preallocate the descriptor if we do it for
one of them, even when it's not actually needed.
