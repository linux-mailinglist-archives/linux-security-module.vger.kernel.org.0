All reasonable and consistent, with what we had previously written
with respect to there being no notion of LSM namespacing.

To further assist Leesoo and others who may be following this, you had
suggested the following earlier in this thread:

Paul> If you are interested in stacking SELinux and AppArmor, I
Paul> believe the only practical solution is to run SELinux on the
Paul> host system (initial namespace) and run AppArmor in the

Which would seem to apply that in a 'stacked' LSM configuration of
SELinux and AppArmor, there would be a possibility of using the two
LSM's without them 'colliding', the equivalent of what could be
considered a 'nested' LSM implementation.

Casey had also suggested in this thread that this would be possible at
the risk of a system that would be difficult to reason about.

Were our previous comments correct, that the path forward would be to
have SELinux configured in a manner where it would not act on any of
the subject/object interactions that occur in the container
environment that is using AppArmor?

If so, would the path forward be to implement an SELinux policy that
would place the process initiating the namespace, and its descendants,
in an unconfined domain with respect to the assets in the scope of the
container?

As always,
