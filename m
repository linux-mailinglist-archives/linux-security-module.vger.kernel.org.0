Hi Simon :

Using a temporary ima_rules variable is not working for "ima_policy_next". void *ima_policy_next(struct seq_file *m, void *v, loff_t *pos) { struct ima_rule_entry *entry = v; + struct list_head *ima_rules_tmp = rcu_dereference(ima_rules); rcu_read_lock(); entry = list_entry_rcu(entry->list.next, struct ima_rule_entry, list); rcu_read_unlock(); (*pos)++; - return (&entry->list == ima_rules) ? NULL : entry; + return (&entry->list == ima_rules_tmp) ? NULL : entry; }

It seems no way to fix "ima_rules" change within this function, it will alway
return a entry if "ima_rules" being changed.

Regrads,

liqiong
