This was written before your previous response.

I don't see that happening in this patch, did I miss it?

Again, why are you adding flags when the patch does not use them?
Please put new functionality in the specific patch that uses it.

And can you really rely on this?  How did sgx_reclaimer_* (whatever that
is), get the reference on this object in the first place?  Again, I
don't see that happening at all in here, and at a quick glance in the
other patches I don't see it there either.  What am I missing?

What is that referencing?

Ok, but how did it get access to this structure in the first place, like
I ask above?

What number in this series?

Having 2 char nodes in a subdir is better than one, I will give you
that.  But none is even better, don't you think?
