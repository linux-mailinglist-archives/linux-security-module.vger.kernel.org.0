Oops, thanks - I also meant to have the [RFC] subject prefix.

Sounds good - I'll gather some more data and get back.

(I would also reiterate what KP said in response
to James: the "worst case" relative indirect call overhead (i.e. the case
where the hook callback does minimal work) is exactly the case we care
about here. If the callback is doing enough work that the indirect call overhead
becomes negligible, that callback is probably anyway too heavyweight for the
use cases that motivated this work).

Hmm yeah that's a cool idea. This would either need to be implemented
with custom
code-modification logic for the LSM hooks, or we'd need to think of a
way to express it
in a sensible addition to the static_call API. I do wonder if the
latter could take
the form of a generic system for arrays of static calls.

It would also need to handle the fact that IIUC at the moment the last
static_call may be a tail
call, so we'd be patching an existing jump into a jump to a different
target, I don't know if we
can do that atomically.

More research required on my side here, on both points.

Yep, this is intentional - Paul is the sole author so far (I suppose
KP's sign-off
is not technically required since he's also at the Google).
