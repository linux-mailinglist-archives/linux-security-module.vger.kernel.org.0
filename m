I can take a look, but I'm not really convinced this isn't going to
cause me grief at some point in the future when the kernel adds
support for another capability and all' does not equal all. I've done
some digging and I thought it was worth writing up.

Today, the kernel treats 'all' (as it is defined by libcap today)
differently for file and process capabilities. I suspect this is
contributing to expectations about what all means, because all as
defined today is effectively useless, and somewhere in the kernel
we've worked around it for filecaps when we shouldn't have.

Explanation of kernel bug (no use of 'all' here):

1) placing, say, bit-63 (undef today) and bit-0 (cap_chown) on the
permitted (fP) vector of a file, yields a file that can execute - it
gets pP=cap_chown.

cd libcap/progs ; make ; cp capsh pcapsh ; sudo setcap
63,cap_setpcap,cap_chown=p pcapsh

./pcapsh --print

2) dropping cap_chown from the bounding set causes this same file to
not run (insufficient privilege) because the file has been setup to
require cap_chown, but can't have it so (by design) we deny execution
altogether -- this fails:

./pcapsh --drop=cap_chown --print == --print

To be consistent, (1) should fail because bit-63 is being dropped by
the bounding set at execution time. That is, a binary that requires
some future definition for capability #63 to run successfully should
fail on a kernel that does not support it today.  This but was
introduced with this kernel commit:

https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/security/commoncap.c?id=7d8b6c63751cfbbe5eef81a48c22978b3407a3ad

Ironically, the commit message declares the fact that (4) now passes
is the fix. The real fix is to think about what we mean by 'all'.

Cheers

Andrew
