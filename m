That was entirely my mistake. Mimi and the linux-integrity list was CC'd 
on previous
versions (Roberto actually added the list to his responses) - when I was 
reconstructing
the To: line with get-maintainers.pl, the list didn't pop up and I did 
not remember to
add it manually. I've corrected my mailing script to re-add them again.
