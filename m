Yes and no.  If the person relying on the logs is happy they've
extracted all the evidentiary value from the log itself then they can
reduce the preceding log shard to simply the PCR values that match the
quote and discard the rest.

For incremental attestation.  Each log shard can be verified using the
base PCR values corresponding to the bottom quote then replayed and the
top quote verified.  This means that logs that aren't needed anymore
can be discarded, which, I recall, was the base reason for this
proposal: reducing IMA memory consumption.  Although all you need to do
is extract the shards from kernel memory to file space and free the
kernel memory.  Since that scheme can keep all logs intact, there's no
reason to further reduce them unless the filesystem is running out of
space.
