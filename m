I think those concerns can be resolved, see below for more
information, the second patch series that we are closing in on should
help address the concerns that are currently on the table.

That being said, since TSEM is a new codebase, we were hoping that you
could give us some guidance on function local variable ordering.
Reverse Christmas tree seems popular writ large in the kernel, I
believe that you commented in a posting a month or two ago that you
prefer standard Christmas tree, SMACK and SeLinux don't seem to
religiously embrace a style.

Our codebase uses ordering based on least complex to most complex
variables and has worked for us, both in the kernel and elsewhere, but
we are ambivalent, as our primary objective is to avoid wasting
everyone's time on issues such as this.

So we would look forward to a recommendation, given that it shouldn't
involve wasting any time looking at code.

The discussion on this has caused us to implement changes, that will
be in V2, that should better justify the measurement value, but see

Least complex answer; minimalism in the initial implementation, which
from your previous comments would seem to be a virtue.

Slightly more complex; the current models that we are training don't
benefit from numerical resolution beyond what is in the initial
implementation.

Some clarifications that may be useful:

Filenames are no more, or no less, important in TSEM than any of the
other parameters of the security event basis set.  The security
relevant entity is the coefficient that gets computed for the event.

As the 'Event modeling' section of the TSEM documentation points out,
the security coefficient is a functional product of the event, task,
COE and CELL identities.  Simplisticaly, a generically modeled event
operates under the presumption that the security model will only be
dependent on whether or not a particular portion of executable memory,
executed by a process with defined characteristics, is requesting
approval for a specific security event.

If the (EVENT:TASK:COE) tuple has not been shown to generate, for
example, a filename rename, the event will be denied.  If a rename is
allowed, and it results in a pathname that has not been included in
the model, an attempt to subsequently access the file will also result
in a pertubation of the model state.

A critical element in all of this is the notion of modeling namespaces
that reduce the complexity scope of the implemented models.  As an
additional, and hopefully helpful example, a micro-services
application running in a container may never demonstrate the need to
rename or unlink a file.  An attempt to do so, if for example the
application were compromised, will be denied, regardless of the object
of the rename.

We have additional work that will be forthcoming on this issue, but as
you noted above, and in the last e-mail, better to be simple first.

We have already validated the implementation for allowing the user
namespace reference for a modeling domain to be selected on a domain
by domain basis.

We will document these issues, FWIW, some clarifications that may be
helpful for those following this discussion.

For an internally modeled domain, there are no separate entities to be
concerned about.  The processes that execute in the context of the
domain will model their events based on whatever user namespace they
are in.  If the user namespace changes, the representative
characteristics being used will change, which would seem to be
reasonable, if the domain has been configured to be sensitive to the
user namespace mappings that the process is running in.

In an externally modeled domain, by definition, the modeling process
must be in a different modeling domain than the modeled process.  Our
reference to Heisenberg, in the documentation, was not by
happenstance, the act of modeling would perturb the state of the
modeled system.

The modeling process and the modeled processes can run in separate or
different user namespaces.  The modeling process and the modeled
processes will generate and report their derived security state
coefficients to different modeling domains.

Yes, somewhat more specifically, we implemented the requirement for
mutual authentication between an external TMA and the modeled process.

If we understand the concern correctly, this would imply that a
malicious process has read/write access to arbitrary kernel memory
that it is not allowed to access, which would seem to represent a
catastrophic security event that cannot be defended against.

I think the appropriate metaphor, in classic subject/object security
models, would be if a malicious process had the ability to modify
either its own or another processes label, i.e if CAP_MAC_ADMIN were
lost to an adversary.

The current codebase no longer supports anything other than
authenticated trust control.

Yes, in TSEM, the 'measurement' value can be used to validate the
order that the security state coefficients, ie. the values surfaced in
the /sys/kernel/security/tsem/points pseudo-file, were generated in.

Yes, that is classically the explanation that is given for having an
ordered event log.  That being said, we tend to struggle with the
validity of this thinking, that is not criticism, perhaps more of a
lack of understanding on our part.

Let's consider IMA, or TSEM running in a model context that only
observes the integrity of binaries run with root privileges, roughly
equivalent implementations.  In either scenario, you have an
attestation of the fact that a known binary executed in a known
temporal order, but does that tell you the final state of the system
from a security perspective?

Take iptables as an example, given its potential contribution to the
trust status of a system.  If you know that it executed twice, can it
be effectively reasoned what it was doing each time it executed,
without access to things like the command-line arguments?

Conceptually, in an extremely static system configuration, the rule
might be that system attestation fails if iptables ran more than once,
but in a multi-execution scenario it is unclear what can be reasoned.

FWIW, from a design perspective, we try to operate under the
assumption that there are well understood architectural predicates
that secure systems can be built on.

For example, the statistical infeasibility of predicting a large
number generated by a random number generator with known numerical
characteristics or the lack of a direct solution to the discrete
logarithm problem.

We bin the chronological infeasibility of wrapping a 64-bit counter in
the same bucket, perhaps that is an oversight on our part.

Given the current performance hit that speculative execution has given
us, with respect to indirect function calls, it would seem that the
LSM is going to be a problematic architecture, particularly with any
type of stacking.... :-)

TSEM/V2 now can use any hash function that a kernel has available, it
was actually a remarkably straight forward implementation.

Nor would we, but it is now available if anyone wants it.... :-)

We are now validating against multiple hash implementations, each with
multiple digest sizes, so hopefully this will lay the cryptographic
agility issue to rest.

FWIW, we do appreciate your perspective on these issues, the
implementation has already improved as a result of your concerns.

Have a good remainder of the week.
