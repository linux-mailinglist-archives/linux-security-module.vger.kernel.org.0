This patch description can be written more concisely.

Patch 1/3 in this series introduces measuring the kexec boot command
line.  This patch defines a new template field for storing the kexec
boot command line in the measurement list in order for a remote
attestation server to verify.

As mentioned, the first patch description should include a shell
command for verifying the digest in the kexec boot command line
measurement list record against /proc/cmdline.  This patch description
should include a shell command showing how to verify the digest based
on the new field.  Should the new field in the ascii measurement list
be displayed as a string, not hex?
