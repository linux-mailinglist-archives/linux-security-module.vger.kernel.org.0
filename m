What about this?

* Every hook must demonstrate its usefulness and be actually used by
  in-kernel code.  This is required to understand the purpose of the LSM
  hooks, their expected semantic, and to be able to guarantee security
  properties throughout kernel code changes (e.g., thanks to regression
  testing).  This means that out-of-tree kernel code and pass-through
  implementations (e.g., BPF LSM) are not eligible for such reference
  implementations.

I think explicitly using "threat model" in this paragraph would be a
good idea.

Ok, see my comments in the updated doc.
