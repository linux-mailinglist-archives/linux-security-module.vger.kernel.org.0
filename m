No there are nothing special about clock. Any selinux policy should do,.

There wasn't a rule for user_home_t. These scripts demonstrate that 
during a selinux policy reload, IMA would measure files that is not in 
the range of it's LSM based rules. Which is the issue I am trying to fix.

In this test, we only have one rule for measuring files of type 
unlabeled_t. However, during selinux policy reload, file of user_home_t 
is also measured.
