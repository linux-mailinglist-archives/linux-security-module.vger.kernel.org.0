AFAIK from my prior experience while working with CAAM engine during
my time at NXP, it is generally a crypto engine with additional
security properties like one discussed here to protect keys (blob
encap and decap) etc. But it doesn't offer user authentication similar
to what a TPM (ownership) can offer. Although, one should be able to
expose CAAM via /dev node but I am not sure if that would be really
useful without user authentication. I think similar should be the case
for other crypto engines with additional security properties.

With restriction of CAAM's security properties to kernel crypto we
could at least ensure a kernel boundary that should offer enough
resistance from malicious user space attacks.

With regards to trusted keys generated using the TEE's RNG, the
underlying implementation being OP-TEE [1] which is an open source TEE
implementation built on top of Arm TrustZone providing the hardware
based isolation among the TEE and Linux. So regarding auditability, it
should be comparatively easier to audit the TEE components designed
with a goal of minimal footprint when compared with Linux kernel.

Yes in case of TPM, default is still TPM's RNG but with Ahmad's patch
#2, the trust source backend like CAAM should be able to use kernel's
RNG by default.
