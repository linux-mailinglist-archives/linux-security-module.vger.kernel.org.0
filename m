Those applications were already able to use the encrypted key support
in dm-crypt. For those where re-encryption/PCR-sealing isn't required,
direct trusted key support offers a simpler way to integrate.

More users = more use cases. You make it sound like a negative
thing.

So you'd be fine with merging trusted key support as is and leave encrypted
key support to someone who has a valid use case and wants to argue
in its favor?
