Returning success if uctx==NULL and uctx_len is big enough sends the
message that this -sending a non-zero length and uctx=NULL is a
recommended use case.  It should not be a recommended use.

If the user wants to find out the size of the buffer, they can already
do so more reliably in the pre-existing way, passing in a *length=0 (and
a NULL or random uctx).  I say more reliable, because they can predict
the function return value in this case: -E2BIG.

So the only way uctx==NULL and uctx_len!=0 should happen is by accident,
and in that case sending back 'success' is misleading.

If you've received garbage, you should let the sender know, rather than
return 'success' in the hopes that it wasn't important.

But anyway I'll stop here - it doesn't break anything directly, I just
think it's a bad API with the potential for future harder to spot bugs.
