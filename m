The proposal is growing on me.

One way to view transfer_creds() and have it nicely fit into the credential=
s API
would be to view prepare_creds() as a convenience wrapper around
transfer_creds(), so that prepare_creds() is implemented as a function whic=
h:

  1) allocates a new struct cred (this may fail)
  2) calls transfer_creds() with the new struct cred to populate

We could then move the bulk of its existing prepare_creds() implementation =
into
the new transfer_creds(), and could also move the keyctl implementation to =
use
that.

A remaining problem is: The caveat and the underlying assumption is that
transfer_creds() must never fail when it runs in the task work, if we want =
to
avoid the additional synchronization.  The existing cases in which the
credentials preparation logic can return an error are:

* Allocation failure for struct cred  (we would get rid of this)
* get_ucounts(new->ucounts) returns NULL  (not supposed to happen, AFAICT)
* security_prepare_creds() fails.  Existing LSM implementations are:
  * Tomoyo, SELinux, AppArmor, Landlock: always return 0
  * SMACK: May return -ENOMEM on allocation failure


So summing up, in my understanding, the prerequisites for this approach are=
 that:

  1) get_ucounts() never returns NULL, and

  2) SMACK does not bubble up allocation errors from the cred_prepare hook

     Casey, Jarkko: do you think this is realistic for SMACK to change?

and that

  3) We can block new thread creation

     Micka=C3=ABl, do you have a specific approach in mind for that?

     As Jann pointed out in [1], the tasklist_lock and siglock are not slee=
pable
     and can't be used while waiting, which is why he proposed an approach =
where
     we retry in a loop until no new threads show up any more, while gettin=
g the
     existing threads stuck in the task_work as well (where they can't spaw=
n new
     threads).
