machine_signing_key.x509 appears to be a code-signing, self-signed key.  
It's not a CA key, but the intent of the patchset is to load only CA 
keys to .machine keyring.

Shouldn't there be two steps: one to load the CA key into MOK, and a 
second one to load the code-signing key which is signed by this CA ?
