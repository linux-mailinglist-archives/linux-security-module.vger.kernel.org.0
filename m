I hope to get an answer from him.

That makes sense, since it is not the kernel holding secrets on behalf
of user space, it is user space passing the crypto material to the
kernel (if I remember IPSEC correctly). Failure of user space to hold
its secrets or to tamper with the task has only effect in user space.

With my understanding, I'm citing a source enumerating the requirements
of a secure system:

James P. Anderson: Computer Security Technology Planning Study

The first requirement of a component enforcing a security policy on a
Target of Evaluation (TOE), aka the reference monitor, is that it must
be tamperproof [1].

The security policy I want to enforce is: all code that the system
executes has been built by a trusted source (e.g. a Linux
distribution).

I want to leverage the kernel to enforce such security policy, and I
assume that the kernel can be fortified enough (for example through the
lockdown LSM) to be considered tamperproof against the TOE (the user
space processes).

The first problem I see in delegating the public crypto task to user
space is that it is at the same time part of the reference monitor
(since it is used to enforce the security policy) and it is a TOE too.

The second problem is, assuming that the task is verified through other
means other than PGP (but again, we are still relying on the public
crypto functionality to be performed by the kernel, for this to work),
that I didn't get a confirmation that user space can have equivalent
isolation guarantees as the kernel:

https://lore.kernel.org/linux-integrity/eb31920bd00e2c921b0aa6ebed8745cb013=
0b0e1.camel@huaweicloud.com/


Please, keep in mind that I already proposed what you suggested:

https://lore.kernel.org/linux-kernel/20230317145240.363908-1-roberto.sassu@=
huaweicloud.com/#r


After discussing with some kernel developers, the outcome was that a
better choice would be to put the code in the kernel, if I want
reasonable tamperproof guarantees.

Thanks

Roberto
