If the problem is kernel memory, then using a single tmpfs file has
already been proposed [1].  As entries are added to the measurement
list, they are copied to the tmpfs file and removed from kernel memory.
Userspace would still access the measurement list via the existing
securityfs file.

The IMA measurement list is a sequential file, allowing it to be read
from an offset.  How much or how little of the measuremnt list is read
by the attestation client and sent to the attestation server is up to
the attestation client/server.

If the problem is not kernel memory, but memory pressure in general,
then instead of a tmpfs file, the measurement list could similarly be
copied to a single persistent file [1].

Please fix the mailer so that it doesn't wrap sentences.   Adding blank

This design seems overly complex and requires synchronization between
the "snapshot" record and exporting the records from the measurement
list.  None of this would be necessary if the measurements were copied
from kernel memory to a backing file (e.g. tmpfs), as described in [1].

What is the real problem - kernel memory pressure, memory pressure in
general, or disk space?  Is the intention to remove or offload the
exported measurements?

Concerns:
- Pausing extending the measurement list.
