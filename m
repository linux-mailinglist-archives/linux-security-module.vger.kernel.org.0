I am referring to any module that includes an appended signature.  They =
could be signed at build time or anytime afterwards using =
/usr/src/kernels/$(uname -r)/scripts/sign-file.  As long as the public =
key is contained in the builtin kernel trusted keyring.

Correct, before the changes added to 5.4 [1], it was not possible to =
have a digital signature based appraisal policy that worked with a =
compressed module.  This is because you can=E2=80=99t ima sign a =
compressed module, since the signature would be lost by the time it gets =
to the init_module syscall.  With the changes in [1] you can, if you =
include =E2=80=9Cmodsig=E2=80=9D to your policy, which allows the =
appended module to be checked instead.


> Since the modules are signed with build time generated keys, the =

the .builtin keyring and not the .ima keyring.

Currently the upstream code will fail if the module is uncompressed.  If =
you compress the same module it will load with the current upstream =
code.

> Lastly, there is nothing in these patches that indicate that the =
kernel modules being compressed/uncompressed is related to the signature =
verification.
>=20

Basically if you have the following setup:

Kernel built with CONFIG_IMA_ARCH_POLICY or kernel booted with =
module.sig_enforce=3D1 along with the following ima policy:

appraise func=3DMODULE_CHECK appraise_type=3Dimasig|modsig

If you have a module foo.ko that contains a valid appended signature but =
is not ima signed, it will fail to load.  Now if the enduser simply =
compresses the same foo.ko, making it foo.ko.xz.  The module will load.

Modules can be loaded thru two different syscalls, finit_module and =
init_module.  The changes added in [1] work if you use the init_module =
syscall.  My change adds support when the finit_module syscall gets used =
instead.
