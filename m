I'm going to disagree on that quite severely.  As I mentioned
previously there isn't an easy or sane way to delimit between the
different LSM labels which means sorting out the multiplexed "subj"
field is going to be a post processing nightmare.

All of the options we've discussed still record the LSM credentials in
the audit record; no one is talking about *not* recording the LSM
credentials.  What we are discussing is *how* they are recorded.

I can almost guarantee that looking for subj/subj_X is going to be
much easier than safely parsing a multiplexed subj field.  Not to
mention the multiplexed approach is just awful to read compared to
some of the other suggestions.

The subj_X approach is still backwards compatible, the difference is
that old versions of the tools get a "?" for the LSM creds which is a
rather sane way of indicating something is different.  The multiplexed
approach would result in effectively garbage for the LSM creds unless
the higher layers of audit tooling are updated to understand the new
multiplexed format *and* *continuously* *updated* as new LSMs are
stacked because you need to understand each LSMs label format if you
are going to safely parse the multiplexed format.  With the subj_X
approach the higher layer tooling simply needs to look for subj_X
fields when it sees "subj=?", and then it can safely extract/parse
each LSM's label without needing to understand or inspect the labels
themselves.

Once again, I believe that the subj_X approach is going to be faster
than safely parsing the multiplexed format.
