Thanks, Casey.

"[6/7] doc: keys: Document usage of TEE based Trusted Keys" refers to
the kernel tee documentation, but that documentation is limited to
userspace interaction with the tee.

A trusted key is a random number generated and sealed(encrypted) by
the TPM, so that only the TPM may unseal it.  The sealing key never
leaves the TPM.  The sealed, trusted key may be exported to userspace.
 In the tee case, can the "sealing" key ever leave the tee?  Can the
sealed, trusted key, exported to userspace, be unsealed by the tee?
 Are the tee security protections similar to those of the TPM?  How do
they compare?
