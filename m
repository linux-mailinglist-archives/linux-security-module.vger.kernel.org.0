I want to be very careful about the comments I make on this patch set.
I can't say that I trust any fix for the BPF LSM layer. My natural
inclination is to isolate the fix to the area that has the problem,
that is, BPF. I have a hard time accepting the notion that the implementation
will really fix all possible bugs in the future. The pace at which eBPF
is evolving gives me the heebee geebees when I think of it as a mechanism
for implementing security modules.

My biggest concern is that we may be trying too hard for perfection.
I see a situation where we're not moving forward because there are two
reasonable solutions and rather than running with either we're desperately
looking for a compelling reason to pick one over the other.
