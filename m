Brief follow up on this; I changed it to return a special error EBADFD
in the places in the test_foo() helpers where I previously used
ASSERT_EQ. The errors checked there are errors from open() and close()
in cases where they are needed as prerequisites or cleanups to the
actual thing we want to test.

Specifically open() can also return EACCES due to Landlock policies,
and I don't want to confuse that with the EACCES that ftruncate() may
return.

I use EBADFD because it's a reasonably obscure error code and should
not overlap. (Suggestions welcome)

Ack, thanks :)
