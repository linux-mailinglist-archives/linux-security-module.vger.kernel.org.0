Hi Kees, et al.,

Kees, you were the first person who came to mind to ask about this, feel free to
point me to someone else.

While reviewing a patch-set for hw-enablement of some upcoming Melanox platforms,
the addition of some sysfs files which flip write-protect bits for various firmwares
found on the platform on/off stood out to me.

As I mention in me reply to the below patch adding the docs for this at a minimum
this must (IMHO) tie into the new lockdown framework and disallow enabling
fw-updates this way depending on the lockdown mode.

Are there any other security checks which the code should/could do here ?

Maybe tie into the audit code somehow ?

Regards,

Hans
