+descriptor and will be used for subsequent truncation and ioctl attempts u=

+As a consequence, it is possible that a process has multiple open file
+descriptors referring to the same file, but Landlock enforces different th=
ings
+when operating with these file descriptors.  This can happen when a Landlo=
ck
+ruleset gets enforced and the process keeps file descriptors which were op=
ened
+both before and after the enforcement.  It is also possible to pass such f=
ile
+descriptors between processes, keeping their Landlock properties, even whe=
n some
+of the involved processes do not have an enforced Landlock ruleset.
+
+Restricting IOCTL commands
+--------------------------
+
+When the ``LANDLOCK_ACCESS_FS_IOCTL`` access right is handled, Landlock wi=
ll
+restrict the invocation of IOCTL commands.  However, to *permit* these IOC=
TL
+commands again, some of these IOCTL commands are then granted through othe=
r,
+preexisting access rights.
+
+For example, consider a program which handles ``LANDLOCK_ACCESS_FS_IOCTL``=
 and
+``LANDLOCK_ACCESS_FS_READ_FILE``.  The program *permits*
+``LANDLOCK_ACCESS_FS_READ_FILE`` on a file ``foo.log``.
+
+By virtue of granting this access on the ``foo.log`` file, it is now possi=
ble to
+use common and harmless IOCTL commands which are useful when reading files=
, such
+as ``FIONREAD``.
+
+On the other hand, if the program permits ``LANDLOCK_ACCESS_FS_IOCTL`` on
+another file, ``FIONREAD`` will not work on that file when it is opened.  =
As
+soon as ``LANDLOCK_ACCESS_FS_READ_FILE`` is *handled* in the ruleset, the =
IOCTL
+commands affected by it can not be reenabled though ``LANDLOCK_ACCESS_FS_I=
OCTL``
+any more, but are then governed by ``LANDLOCK_ACCESS_FS_READ_FILE``.
+
+The following table illustrates how IOCTL attempts for ``FIONREAD`` are
+filtered, depending on how a Landlock ruleset handles and permits the
+``LANDLOCK_ACCESS_FS_IOCTL`` and ``LANDLOCK_ACCESS_FS_READ_FILE`` access r=

+IOCTL support
+-------------
+
+The ``LANDLOCK_ACCESS_FS_IOCTL`` access right restricts the use of
+:manpage:`ioctl(2)`, but it only applies to newly opened files.  This mean=
s
+specifically that pre-existing file descriptors like stdin, stdout and std=
err
+are unaffected.
+
+Users should be aware that TTY devices have traditionally permitted to con=
trol
+other processes on the same TTY through the ``TIOCSTI`` and ``TIOCLINUX`` =
IOCTL
+commands.  It is therefore recommended to close inherited TTY file descrip=
tors,
+or to reopen them from ``/proc/self/fd/*`` without the
+``LANDLOCK_ACCESS_FS_IOCTL`` right, if possible.  The :manpage:`isatty(3)`
+function checks whether a given file descriptor is a TTY.
+
+Landlock's IOCTL support is coarse-grained at the moment, but may become m=
ore
+fine-grained in the future.  Until then, users are advised to establish th=
e
+guarantees that they need through the file hierarchy, by only permitting t=
he

In
+cases where you can control the mounts, the ``nodev`` mount option can hel=
