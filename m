Your initial question was "what happens if the file/filesystem becomes
inaccessible at some point and an attestation client attempts to read
the entire log?".  For what reason would it be inaccessible?  For the
original single tmpfs file, what would make it inaccessible?  In the
"snapshotting" design this problem becomes a userspace issue.

The first sentence of the cover letter is "Depending on the IMA policy,
the IMA log can consume a lot of Kernel memory on the device." 
Copying/exporting the measurements from kernel memory to a single
(tmpfs) file resolves the kernel memory pressure issue.  The entire
measurement list would remain accessible via the securityfs file.  As
previously mentioned in this thread, it wouldn't resolve the kexec
issue of allocating a buffer large enough for really large measurement
lists.

If the real motivation for this patch set is trimming the measurement
list, the cover letter needs to say that.  The existing "snapshotting"
design requires locking of the entire measurement list while copying
and trimming it.  The "snapshotting" design needs to be simplified. 
Perhaps a trusted userspace process could copy the measurements and
then trigger trimming of the in kernel memory/tmpfs measurement list.
