Right, I didn't mean "blanket" in the sense of "permission to do
anything on the system"; I do get that you can restrict which subset of
functionality you grant. However, *within* that subset, it's a blanket
permission grant. I.e., you can't issue a token that grants a *specific*
application permission to load a *specific* BPF program - you can only
grant a general "load any program" permission that can be used by anyone
who possesses the token.

I guess we could in principle extend the token mechanism to allow this,
but the kernel doesn't seem like the right place to implement such a
fine-grained policy engine...

Which is exactly why setuid binaries are not generally how we implement
security delegation these days. So I don't think designing a new
mechanism this way is a good idea.

Right, OK, that bit does sound pretty tedious (although I'll note that
there are people who are trying to make all this generally more
palatable[0]).

However, all that tediousness could be avoided while still retaining the
model of blocking the syscall and asking a userspace policy daemon to
supply a verdict. This could even be done using the same token
mechanism: instead of attaching a permission to the token itself, just
make it an opaque identifier. Then, when a syscall is made that contains
the token, block it and send a notification to user space and use the
verdict that comes back in place of the token "value". The notification
could go through the same file descriptor (using read/write or an ioctl,
restricted to CAP_SYS_ADMIN), or it could be a separate one that is
returned alongside it on TOKEN_CREATE. The notification could include
all of the syscall args or a subset, depending on the command, but the
kernel can ensure there are no TOCTOU races, and no need for the policy
daemon to go poking into other another process' namespace.

Actually, using this model I don't think we would even strictly speaking
need the explicit token FD to be included by the calling application
inside the container at all? I.e., if the system policy daemon could
just instruct the kernel "please delegate all permission decisions for
this user namespace to me", it could - so to speak - issue tokens on
demand as each call is made, instead of ahead of time. Which would both
enable the policy daemon to make specific usage decisions, and wouldn't
require any change needed to the applications using BPF inside the
container (not even to include the BPF token FD).
