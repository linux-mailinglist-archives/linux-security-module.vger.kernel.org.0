Not to throw a wet blanket on your argument, but you can do just that
with a combination of the audit trail and Smack. Well, mostly. You can't
retroactively deny an access, but you can change the Smack label on a
file or change the access rules as desired. What you can't do is detain
an event while user space is queried about the decision. That is, I
believe, the fundamental problem with your approach.

"Work with" sometimes means you don't get everything you thought you
wanted in the way you wanted it. Refer to the work on LSM stacking,
which looks very different now than it did when I started on it in 2010.

You aren't crying anything new. It's not easy to address all of the
issues necessary to make a chunk of code acceptable to the Linux
kernel. I doesn't help that you're crying in a language in which much
of your audience is not fluent.
