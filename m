Thanks for running the numbers and testing these patches, greatly appreciat=
ed!

> @KP Singh, I would have appreciated being cc-ed here, since I provided

Definitely, a miss on my part. Will keep you Cc'ed in any future revisions.

I think we can also add a Tested-by: tag on the main patch and add
your performance numbers to the commit as well.
