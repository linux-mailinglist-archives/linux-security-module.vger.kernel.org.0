That would be better indeed.

[rewinding] …well, this title would go away if I merge this subsection

Yes. This is confusing because it sets the default value of cmdline. 
I'll rephrase this paragraph.

I was thinking about "Kernel boot configuration" but I'll try to merge 
the two configuration subsections and put the check subsection earlier.
