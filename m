Your concern over the state of the LSM has been previously noted, and
I assure you I've rolled my eyes at each reference since.

I've repeated my position once already, if any current or aspiring LSM
developers are unsure about some aspect of this, they are welcome to
bring their specific concerns to the list and we can discuss them.

I would suggest that your interpretation of my previous comments are a
bit "off" in my opinion, but who am I to argue with a view that sees
my comments as this fascinating!

Jokes aside, to be clear I didn't tell you not to continue to post
newer revisions of TSEM, I simply suggested that based on the choices
you've made in designing and developing TSEM, it may be better suited
to a downstream solution and not the upstream Linux kernel.  However,
perhaps continuing to post a LSM that has not been accepted upstream
due to inherent design decisions is perfectly in keeping with a LSM
that relishes references to Don Quixote.
