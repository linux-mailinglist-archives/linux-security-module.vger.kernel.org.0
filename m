I have the impression that none the functionality you cited has to be
implemented in the kernel, because the only component one can trust to
verify the integrity of the IMA measurements list is the TPM. Whether
either the kernel or user space retain the measurements is irrelevant.

I believe that the only role of the kernel is to get rid of the
measurements entries as fast as possible (the kernel would act more
like a buffer).

This was actually the intent of my original proposal in
https://github.com/linux-integrity/linux/issues/1 . The idea of staging
(was snapshotting, but Mimi thinks the term is not accurate) is simply
to detach the entire IMA measurement list as fast as possible. Further
read and delete after staging is done without interfering with new
measurements (sure, the detaching of the hash table is not yet as
efficient as I hoped).

Anything that you said about verifying the measurements up to a certain
TPM quote can be implemented in user space without a decrease in
security. I don't see the need to synchronize the trim with the
verification in the kernel.
