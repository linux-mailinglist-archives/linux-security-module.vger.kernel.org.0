If you don't see a "RFC" in the patch subject line it's safe to assume
it is a "final" version.  Regardless, feedback is never bad, even if
it is a RFC.

Unsurprising.  Those patches were mostly just to relocate the comment
blocks out of lsm_hooks.h and into security.c; while I did fix some of
the really bad errors, fixing everything in the move wasn't really the
goal, that's for future work.

Did you want to submit a patch to fix those?
