What can be done in the kernel to ignore some policy rules could also be
done in a tool managing different policies. For instance, a simple tool
can instantiate a human-written policy into multiple backward compatible
policies (according to different versions of supported kernels). The
appropriate policy could then be fetched on the fly by the nodes or
pushed by an orchestration system.

With your constraints in mind, I still think that flexible policy
management can be achieved with strict kernel policy parsing. The
complexity should be handled by infrastructure management system.
