I’ve heard a lot of people use these terms in overloaded ways.

If we’re working with the definition of authenticity being
“the property that a resource was _actually_ sent/created by a
party”, and integrity being “the property that a resource was not
modified from a point of time”, then yes. Though the statement isn’t
false, though, because you’d need to prove integrity in the process of
proving authenticity.

If not, could you clarify what you mean by authenticity and integrity,
so that we can use consistent definitions?

We looked at extending IMA to cover our requirements extensively the 
past year
based on feedback the last time I posted these patches. We implemented a
prototype that had half of our requirements, but found it resulted in a
large change list that would result in a large amount of pain in respect
to maintenance, in addition to other more architectural concerns about the
implementation. We weren’t convinced it was the correct direction, for our
needs.

There was a presentation done at LSS 2021 around this prototype done by my
colleague, Fan, who authored this patch and implemented the aforementioned
prototype.

In general, IMA provides a whole suite of amazing functionality when it
comes to everything integrity, as the fs-verity documentation states
itself:

    IMA specifies a system-wide policy that specifies which
    files are hashed and what to do with those hashes, such
    as log them, authenticate them, or add them to a
    measurement list.

Instead, IPE provides a fine-tuned way to _only_ enforce an access control
policy to these files based on the defined trust requirements in the policy,
under various contexts, (you might have different requirements for what
executes in a general purpose, versus loadable kernel modules, for example).
It will never provide bother to log, measure, or revalidate these hashes 
because
that’s not its purpose. This is why it belongs at the LSM layer instead 
of the
integrity subsystem layer, as it is providing access control based on a 
policy,
versus providing deep integrations with the actual integrity claim.

IPE is trying to be agnostic to how precisely “trust” is provided, as
opposed to be deeply integrated into the mechanism that provides
“trust”.

Here’s a more complete example:

    policy_name=”fs-exec-only” policy_version=0.0.1
    DEFAULT action=ALLOW

    DEFAULT op=EXECUTE action=DENY
    op=EXECUTE fsverity_digest=<Digest> action=DENY
    op=EXECUTE fsverity_signature=TRUE action=ALLOW

Execution is prohibited unless it is a signed fs-verity file;
However, after one of those executables was signed and published,
an exploitable vulnerability in said executable was found, a new
version was published without that vulnerability. We need to
revoke trust for that executable since it could be used to exploit
the system, so the first rule prevents it from matching the second.

Oof. You’re completely right. The part I was missing is that as time 
goes on,
the secure status of these cryptographic algorithms will change, and 
then we’ll
need a way to migrate between algorithms. Additionally, tooling and the 
like will
likely need a way to identify this from the policy text without 
consulting anything
else. This is a major oversight for general use, the system that this 
was originally
designed for only had support for a subset of the sha2-family (all 
separate lengths)
so I hadn’t even considered it.

It's trivial to correct in a minimal amount of code, making the policy 
express the
digest like so:

    fsverity_digest=<algo>:<digest>

and change the argument passed to the LSM hook to accept a structure 
containing these
two fields.

That said, I, personally, hope that an honest mistake, in a series 
submitted as
an RFC submitted in good faith, is not a reason to discount an entire patch
series.

I hope you continue to provide feedback, as it is invaluable to making this
system better, and making me, personally, a better developer.

I believe the difference in security models comes from this line
(emphasis, mine):

IPE policy is written by a system author who owns the system, but may
not have 100% control over all of the application code running on the
system.  In the case of applications which are not aware of IPE, the policy
can still enforce that all of the code running on the system is trusted.

An example attack of what we're trying to mitigate:  A hostile actor
could downloads a binary off the internet with all required
dependencies into tmpfs and runs their malicious executable.

With us validating this information in the kernel, even if the attacker
downloaded their malicious executable to /tmp and executed it, it would
still fail to pass policy and be denied, as the kernel is the common
entrypoint across all executables.

Operationally, this _could_ be done by digest, but the policies would
quickly become gigantic on a cartoonish proportion, as you'll have to
authorize every single executable and dependency by digest - and
there would be a complicated update story as the policy would have to
be updated to onboard new digests.

By using signatures, we can prevent the policy update, and keep the
policy size small.
