OK, I have missed that part.

mbind outside of the cpuset shouldn't be possible (policy_nodemask). So
if you are configuring cpusets already then mbind should add much to a
problem. I can see how you can have problems when you do not have any
NUMA partitioning in place because mixing NUMA aware and unaware
workloads doesn't really work out well when the memory is short on
supply.
