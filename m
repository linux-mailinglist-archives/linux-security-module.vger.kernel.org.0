Hi Paul, thanks for sending along further comments.

You note below that you haven't had time to look at the code since you
wanted to confirm the TSEM security model before moving forward.

From a development perspective we are now three weeks into what will
become version 2 of the patch series.  So at this point I wouldn't
advocate spending a lot of time on the current patchset.

That being said, if you some have time, we would appreciate a quick
look at the code on your part, with respect to style changes and the
like we can enforce in the second series, ie. ordering of local
variable declarations by length and the like.

Everything has to, and does, pass checkpatch but I don't believe that
utility judgement on issues such as ordering of variable declarations
and the like.

That being said, specific comments follow below on issues you raised.

To provide comparable functionality to TPM based security
architectures, that are currently, considered state of the art for the
security industry.

As our documentation calls out, TSEM's concept of Trusted Modeling
Agent's (TMA's), are being proposed to both explore and implement next
generation hardware assisted security technologies.

Currently, the only measurements that TPM based systems support are
classic linear extension summing, which I believe we all consider to
be problematic.

That being said, the 'measurement' value can be used to validate the
order of the security event execution trajectory.  In that role it
provides the same value that PCR register 10 plays for IMA.

We believe there is a legitimate discussion that can occur, as to
whether or not this classic attestation architecture is relevant, but
it seemed appropriate to support it.

We can certainly pull the export of the measurement value.  In that
case, would you recommend that we also pull the code that extends the
security coefficients from the root modeling domain, if a TPM is
available, into PCR register 11?

Correct.

It represents the set of allowed coefficients in the description of
the functional security state of a workload.

As a bit of further clarification, regarding the security model that
TSEM is based on.

A TMA extracts the event description parameters, now encoded in
JSON.. :-), into a structure and then computes a digest value,
referred to as the 'CELL identity value', over those elements, in
whatever order the TMA elects to do so in.

Further, a TMA implementation may elect to only include certain
characteristics in the computation of the CELL identity, depending on
the model being implemented.

We are currently handling them as generically modeled events so the
current model treats them as whether or not they occurred.

When they get promoted to explicitly modeled events, the current
presumption would be to include the involved filenames in the
description of the event.

FWIW, based on feedback we have received, there may be a modeling
domain/namspace setup option forthcoming that allows a trust
orchestrator to request that the uid/gid et.al characteristics be
exported in the context of the current user namespace.

The second version of the TSEM series, now includes support for a
requirement that a process being externally modeled, authenticate
itself to the TMA in order for the trust control call to act on
the process.

As noted above, as an additional protection, the next version of the
series requires that a process authenticate itself as being a member
of the modeling domain in order for the trust status control call to
succeed.

With this implementation, substituting an alternate process would now
require that an adversary break the security context between the TMA
and process in the modeling domain.

We don't disagree on the utility of a scheduling fungible measurement
value.  However, this is an remarkably interesting
conclusion/statement, by the Linux security sub-system maintainer no
less, given that it describes the current state of the art with
respect to hardware security co-processors and trusted system
technology.. :-)

Our intent was not to be incivil, but rather to call out one of the
motivations in the implementation of TSEM, and in a larger context,
the notion of a TMA based security architecture.

A now prehistoric version of TSEM was implemented as a patch on top of
IMA.  We actually built systems for clients on top of that
architecture.  Our concept of a 'state' value was driven by the
difficulties we experienced in implementing, and maintaining, these
systems in a field environment.

We offer the concept of a 'state' value in order to simplify the
attestation model, which classically, has required that a verifying
party review an event log for its validity, after verifying that the
measurement value confirms the integrity of the log.

We thought it was covered thoroughly in the 'Security model functional
definitions' section of the tsem.rst file, but we are reviewing all of
that, including the context of the ABI documentation.

To be clear, PCR 11 is only extended for events generated in the root
modeling domain, a TMA acts as a virtual TPM so it maintains its own
measurement values.

To the specific point, you are correct, the aggregate value is
injected as the first measurement into a modeling domain.

Our analysis suggested that an authentication strategy was the

FWIW, I believe that current thinking is that a nonce based on a
64-bit value is immune from recycling.  The classic metric for a
64-bit counter is that a consumption rate of 1000 values/second yields
a counter cycle time of 584,942,417 years.  Nanosecond rates still
buys you 584 years.

I believe that Jason built the Wireguard protocol on this predicate.

We believe the second series will fully address this issue, without
using nonces, for whatever that is worth.  We can reserve further
discussion once that code is available and submitted for review.

We will further explain the trade-offs between the different modeling

We seem to be in agreement that there will always be a natural tension
between security and performance.  With TSEM our goal is to offer
choices.

If an environment is sensitive to performance defects on the order of
tens of nanoseconds, it would seem unlikely that the architects or
administrators of such systems would be implementing integrity
controls of any kind.  In that context, we are no different than IMA
or IPE, it would seem highly unlikely that such environments are going
to tolerate a security solution involving a cryptographic checksum of
any type.

fTPM's and embedding TPM style functionality on the core, ie. the
Microsoft Pluton model, may change all of this, but currently hitting
a discrete TPM isn't a fast operation either.

So, with respect to choices.

We offer the tsem_mode= kernel command-line argument in order to
support only namespace based modeling.  In that configuration, the
performance penalty is paid only by workloads where a decision is made
to run them in a modeled security environment.

From that point, you have a choice on whether a security namespace
should be internally or externally modeled.  Optimum performance, of
course, would be with an internally modeled domain.

There is also the option of completely disabling TSEM by using the
'lsm=' command-line option

So hopefully all of this indicates honesty with respect to performance
issues.

In any event, we will make it clear in the documentation that electing
to use external modeling will have a performance hit and the
mechanisms available for addressing that issue.

With respect to external modeling, significant advantage is that it
opens the door to being able to implement alternate security models
without writing kernel code, which is not inconsequential, given the
challenges to working in kernel context let alone getting code
upstreamed and accepted by distributions.

In some cases, such as SGX, the only way to integrate those types of
protections into a TMA architecture is to go to userspace.

We currently have micro-controller based TMA implementations that have
embedded CAT-1M cellular modems that allow modeling, auditing and
alerting to be done entirely outside of the kernel.  It is probably no
surprise that it is profoundly easier to build these types of
architectures outside of the kernel.

Certainly sound and well reasoned advice, but the question then becomes
what hashes and what hash lengths, do you have any specific
recommendations?

IMA currently has the options of SHA1, SHA256, SHA512, WHIRLPOOL512
and SM3; is this sufficient coverage, given that SHA1 in a new
implementation like TSEM probably doesn't make any sense?

Our current inclination, for the initial release, in an embrace of
minimalisim, would be to make this a selectable option when a modeling
domain is setup, with the only selectable option being SHA256.  This
would place the onus on userspace to make the decision and doesn't
lock the kernel to an ABI.

We would obviously pair this with a kernel command-line option for the
root modeling domain.

In the meantime we will start work on the infrastructure needed to
support an adequate amount of 'cryptographic agility', whatever group
consensus would suggest that to be..

Let us know if we can provide any additional clarifications.

Otherwise, the most efficient use of your review time would be to give
us a quick overview on any style issues you see.  The second patch
series already represents a sufficient delta that time spent reviewing
the current code for correctnes wouldn't be an optimum use of your
time.
