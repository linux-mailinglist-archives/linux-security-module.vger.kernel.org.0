I would also let user space do the snapshotting but all applications
relying on shards should know where they are located on the system
and what the naming scheme is so they can be  process in proper order.
evmctl for example would have to know where the shards are if keylime
agent had taken snapshots.

Ok.

Yes, client restart not reboot.

Right. Some script should run on boot and delete all contents of the directory where the log
shards are.

I think James was proposing one AK, possibly persisted in the TPM's NVRAM. Still, the less keys
that are involved in this the better...
