Maybe I'm missing something, but if the flags interact in an "OR" manner
wouldn't we need to check both? In your proposal where RESOLVE_UNIX
implies the scoped flag, if a program connects to a unix socket that is within
the domain but does not have an explicit RESOLVE_UNIX exception, we must
still check for the case that the access is scoped.

---

(Given LANDLOCK_ACCESS_FS_RESOLVE_UNIX and LANDLOCK_SCOPE_PATHNAME_UNIX_SOCKET
are set)

case 1: access to socket within domain and no RESOLVE_UNIX rule covers the access

We check first in security_unix_find hook and find there is no rule allowing the access.
After the check fails, because LANDLOCK_SCOPE_PATHNAME_UNIX_SOCKET is set
we then check is_domain_scoped, the check allows the access.

case 2: access to socket outside domain but RESOLVE_UNIX rule covers the access

We check first in security_unix_find hook and find there is a rule allowing the access.
We can allow the access early (short-circuit eval) without calling is_domain_scoped.

case 4: access to socket inside domain and RESOLVE_UNIX covers the access

We check first in security_unix_find hook and find there is a rule allowing the access.
We can allow the access early (short-circuit eval) without calling is_domain_scoped. (same as case 2)


case 4: access to socket outside domain and no RESOLVE_UNIX covers the access

We check first in security_unix_find hook and find there is no rule allowing the access.
After the check fails, because LANDLOCK_SCOPE_PATHNAME_UNIX_SOCKET is set
we then check is_domain_scoped, the check does not allow the access. (it is the combination
of the two checks failing that denied the access).

---

Case 4 is what I'm specifically considering would need to have both blockers listed in a denial audit.
We can't short circuit in that case because we have to check the scoping before denying.
Let me know if I'm misunderstanding this.

(PS: IIRC the hooks used by the LANDLOCK_SCOPE_PATHNAME_UNIX_SOCKET
will never be hit if the check in security_unix_find fails. So some logic to check this
access in security_unix_find will be needed).

As long as it's documented clearly, and future IPCs have similar behavior
I agree that a separate field probably isn't needed.
