Hi Björn,

Thanks for the heads up. Abstract unix sockets don't rely on the
filesystem. In fact the path used as an "abstract address" (after the
leading NULL character) is just a string from the kernel point of view.
There is then no way to properly tie it to filesystem access control
(contrary to unix socket files).

I agree that this might be confusing, but we need network restrictions
to control such socket. We are working on TCP access control [1] which
is a first step into being able to more broadly restrict network access.
We also talked about another complementary approach to more broadly
restrict socket creation [2].

The ptrace restrictions was a minimal requirement to not let processes
trivially bypass any sandbox. There are other missing access control
such as process signaling or networking. We'll get there but it takes
time. In the meantime, seccomp is a nice complement to Landlock to fill
these gaps.

About abstract unix socket control, I think it would be nice to be able
to scope access to such sockets the same way ptrace is limited (but this
time it would be opt-in). I think the same approach would fit well for
signaling too.

This is not a bug even if it might be surprising. We should probably
extend the documentation to explicitly list this example as a
limitation. Feel free to send a patch, or I'll add that to my todo list.

Feel free to share a link to your blog once you published your write up.
