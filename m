No, the verifier is server side.  It would be the agent or the kernel,
client side, which gets the quote and shards the log.  That way the
operation can be done in such a way as to make sure the quote and the
shard point match.  I'd imagine the verifier can provide some sort of
guide as to how big it wants the shards to be and the client complies.

The idea would be the log shard would be self attesting, that's why
quote at beginning and end (and probably PCR state at beginning), so no
verifier required until someone wants to check the log.

That's usually what a runtime verification system is actually
verifying, yes.

A quote is a signature over PCR state signed by an AK, yes.

I don't understand this.  A regular quote is a signature over PCR state
by an AK.  The point about saving the AK in the log for the original is
that if the *kernel* truncates the log and saves it to a file, it needs
to generate both the AK and the quote for the top of the file shard. 
That means the AK/EK binding is unverified, but can be verified by
loading the AK and running the usual tests, which can only be done if
you have the loadable AK, which is why you need it as part of the log
saving proposal.

You have a log shard with PCR state at the beginning and calculated at
the end, both of which you can verify.  How you establish trust in the
starting PCR values of the shard is a policy decision, but the policy
doesn't have to be you see every shard up to boot.  You could take the
word of the system owner on a handoff of responsibility for instance.
