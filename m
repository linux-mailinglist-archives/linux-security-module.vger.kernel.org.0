You may be cooking a response to my previous e-mail so a quick comment
to perhaps constructively shape forward conversations.

We looked at the ESF implementation and if we understand the Mac/Apple
approach an API is supplied to register for security events of
interest.

With TSEM we came at the problem from a framework of supporting the
mathematical modeling of security behavior, a 'y = mx + b' type of
approach.  With an objective of providing complete flexibility with
respect to how the functional definition for security is generated.

The most universal method of doing this, at least in our view, was to
supply the stream of LSM events and their parameters and let a
modeling engine, either in the kernel or userspace, decide how to
filter for and process the events in order to create the functional
definition.

A userspace orchestrator receives a JSON encoded record for each LSM
event to do with as it pleases.  If you feed that into something like
an Elastic or Open Search instance you have a complete compliance
record as to every event that the kernel deemed to have security
implications.

Obviously a lot of events can be generated.  We currently support
policy specific screening of events with standard kernel modules and
doing this with eBPF is our next step.  From an eBPF perspective this
is much more of a lightweight approach than attempting to code for
specific security analytics or behavior analysis.

For example, we implemented the rough equivalent of userspace IMA by
in kernel filtering for security_file_open events invoked with
administrative privileges.

The LSM API isn't considered stable but the reality of security
telemetry in this day and age is that security vendors have to code
for specific LTS kernel releases.  Even with a 'stable' release there
are issues with telemetry acquisition, CrowdStike ended up blue
screening RHEL not too long ago on one of their kernel point releases.

We would be interested as to what you see to be the challenges, from
an EDR vendor perspective, with this approach.

FWIW.  If you namespace the security event stream you end up with the
ability to much more precisely model whether or not a workload is
exhibiting aberrant behavior, while decreasing the event flux rate.
