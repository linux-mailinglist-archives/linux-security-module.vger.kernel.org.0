You said

  I think this needs to be discussed if and when we allow LKM based LSMs."

as a response to

  It is Casey's commitment that the LSM infrastructure will not forbid LKM-based LSMs.
  We will start allowing LKM-based LSMs. But it is not clear how we can make it possible to
  allow LKM-based LSMs.

, and you suggested combination of static calls (for built-in LSMs) and
linked list (for LKM-based LSMs).

So, what is your answer to

  Until I hear the real limitations of using BPF, it's a NAK from me.

? Do you agree to allow dynamically appendable LSM modules?
