Hello, sorry if I missed something simple but I did not understand
what "Automatic inclusions of new LSMs " and "get new LSMs
spontaniously" is about. If I understood the kernel practice
development correctly, when a new LSM will be included, it will have a
dedicated "config SECURITY_MYNEWLSM" which will be default to "n" in
order to respect the "principle of least astonishment". How could such
a new LSM be automatically/spontaneously added to the LSM list?

I understand that this is a tough issue and that the subject might
have been discussed a few years ago, and if that's the case, it would
be nice to have pointers to some clear documentation or past emails
(and it would be very very nice if the kernel documentation was
updated to document the current state of LSM stacking: for example
https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/v5.11/admin-guide/LSM/index.html still
documents the "security=" kernel parameter even though it conflicts
with CONFIG_LSM and can be ignored by the kernel in practise).

Thanks,
Nicolas
