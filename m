The main problem I have is that page alloc code does some internal page
allocator things ("init_on_alloc" - "Fill newly allocated pages and heap
objects with zeroes"), and we're allowing users of page alloc code *that
really shouldn't have to care* to override that behavior, exposing
unnecessary complexity. Mainly: other allocators.

"__GFP_NOINIT_ON_ALLOC" - what exactly does it do?
"__GFP_NO_AUTOINIT" - what exactly does it do?

__GFP_ZERO set: page always zero.
__GFP_ZERO not set: page zero with init_on_alloc, page not necessarily
                    zero without init_on_alloc. Users can find out by 	
                    looking at init_on_alloc.

IMHO, even something like __GFP_DONT_ZERO would be clearer. But I still
somewhat don't like letting users of the buddy override configured
behavior. Yes, it could be used by other alloactors (like hugetlb) to
optimize.

But it could also be used by any driver wanting to optimize the
"init_on_alloc" case, eventually introducing security issues because the
code tries to be smart.
