If the goal is that the verifier always receives a TPM quote aligned
with the measurements, the remote attestation agent in the target
system has to walk over the measurements to find N.

The difference between the approach I was suggesting and Steven's is
that I calculate N after staging all measurements and store the
exceeding measurements locally until the next attestation request. If
the verifier supports it, the exceeding measurements could be stored
also there.

That means that I don't need to walk in the measurement list to stage,
because I stage the entire list (with list_replace()). I do a walk
after detaching, without interfering with the processes adding new
measurements (hot path).

Steven's approach is to read the measurements list to calculate N and
stage/trim the measurement based on N. As Steven/Gregory pointed out,
at this point you could already trim N because you already have the
measurements list.

However, in this case you have to walk through the measurements list as
an RCU reader in the hot path, calculate N, and walk through the
measurements list again as an RCU writer in the hot path to stage/trim
N. In the next attestation request, you would read the previous
exceeding measurements again.

One major obstacle of my approach, as Gregory pointed out, was that
staged measurements were not carried over during kexec(). While I
thought about coordinating remote attestation requests with kexec() in
a management engine, there can be cases where this is harder to
achieve.

I managed to solve that by introducing a third linked list containing
the measurements to delete, by doing another list replace between
staged and measurements to delete (when the 'D' command is issued),
under the hot path lock. That allowed me to take the hot path lock
during kexec() and prepend the staged measurements before the non-
staged ones (that reminded me that I should properly inform user space=20
if kexec() consumed staged measurements before the 'D' command was
executed, i.e. it lost the race with kexec()).

The approach to keep the stage N approach would be necessary if
exceeding measurements cannot be stored either locally or at the
verifier side.

For me it would be fine to keep both approaches, but I still see
advantages of the stage all approach.

Thanks
