User authentication, AFAIK most of the HSMs or PKCS#11 require that
for key import. But IIUC, your suggested approach to load plain key
into kernel keyring and say it's *trusted* without any user
authentication, would it really be a trusted key? What prevents a
rogue user from making his key as the dm-crypt trusted key?

I am not sure why you would call the standardized TEE interface [1] to
be platform-specific, it is meant to be platform agnostic. And I think
we can have openssl_tee_engine on similar lines as the
openssl_tpm2_engine.
