The concern is not with the normal way of updating MOK.

This patch set changes the secondary keyring root of trust, which is
currently the builtin or other keys on the secondary keyring.  My
concern with this change, is that any key on the secondary keyring may
then be directly loaded or used to verify other keys being loaded onto
the IMA keyring.

I really do understand the need for extending the root of trust beyond
the builtin keys and allowing end user keys to be loaded onto a kernel
keyring, but it needs to be done safely.  The first step might include
locally signing the MOK keys being loaded onto the secondary keyring
and then somehow safely providing the local-CA key id to the kernel.

When secure boot is enabled, the IMA arch policy rules verify the kexec
kernel image is properly signed.  When CONFIG_MODULE_SIG is not
configured, it also verifies kernel modules are properly signed.

IMA-appraisal is enabled by distros, but requires labeling the
filesystem with security.ima xattrs, before loading an appraisal
policy.
