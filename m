Subject: [PATCH v5 10/10] IMA: Call queue and dequeue functions to measure keys.
Date:   Mon, 11 Nov 2019 11:33:03 -0800
Message-Id: <20191111193303.12781-11-nramas@linux.microsoft.com>
X-Mailer: git-send-email 2.17.1
In-Reply-To: <20191111193303.12781-1-nramas@linux.microsoft.com>
References: <20191111193303.12781-1-nramas@linux.microsoft.com>
Sender: owner-linux-security-module@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-security-module.vger.kernel.org>

Keys should be queued for measurement if custom IMA policies have
not been applied. Keys queued for measurement, if any, need to be
processed when custom IMA policies have been applied.

This patch adds the call to ima_queue_key_for_measurement in the IMA hook
function and the call to ima_process_queued_keys_for_measurement when
custom IMA policies have been applied.

NOTE:
If the kernel is built with CONFIG_IMA_MEASURE_ASYMMETRIC_KEYS
then the IMA policy for measuring keys should be applied as part of
custom IMA policies. Keys will be queued up until custom policies
are applied and processed when applied.
