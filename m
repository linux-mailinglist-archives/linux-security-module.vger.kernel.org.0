Thank you for this pointer and the others below. I spent a lot of time
the past two days thinking about your email and the links.

Correct. I use the fault handler, proper, though, and optimize it
through careful management of protected vs. unprotected resources, which
pushes me up against the problem of determining specific policies for
each type of kmalloc.

I think a more general solution to this problem, leveraging the POE
mechanism (or just stage-2 translation tables), is to build something on
top of or around CFI.  This is natural since the protections already
assume CFI for the data tagging. I can imagine some GCC plugin or
compiler pass for functions, which can appropriately inject
unlock/relock calls around "critical" functions (part of the paciasp
instrumentation).

In fact, I rewrote the QCOM SMC handler to ensure the lock/unlock
semantics were inlined into the specific data operation context, to
prevent creation of a privilege escalation callgate given a CFI bypass.
I attached the code for this at the end.

I will bring this and some other points up to Kevin.

I've not found the fault handler approach to be too expensive, at least
for a system matching all current guarantees. Once we begin talking
about struct file's f_lock and every kmalloc, I am inclined to agree.

I think a fault handler based solution can still get a lot of distance
if frequently updated fields of structs were indirected through pointers
(and separate kmalloc calls).

One issue with the POE and other solutions I see is also a lack of
infrastructure for applying specific policies to updates on data
structures: it's one thing to lock the page table outside of
set_memory_rw, but another to ensure the arguments to that API are
not corrupted, e.g. overwriting plt->target here?

arch/arm64/net/bpf_jit_comp.c
2417:		if (set_memory_rw(PAGE_MASK & ((uintptr_t)&plt->target),

No response, so I did not stress the issue (should I have?) I ended up
just hacking around Google's GKI, so upstreaming was no longer
necessary.

I guess so, though the vmalloc cases for swap and bpf are important:

void __always_inline patch_jump_to_handler(void *faddr, void *helper)
{
	u32 insn;
	insn = aarch64_insn_gen_branch_imm_ind((unsigned long)faddr,
					       (unsigned long)helper,
					       AARCH64_INSN_BRANCH_NOLINK);
	aarch64_insn_patch_text_nosync_ind(faddr, insn);
}

...

/* This works since even though it is "inline", the function is not
 * inlined, so we can kallsyms reference it and patch it */
void bpf_jit_binary_lock_ro_injector(struct bpf_binary_header *hdr)
{
	/* set_vm_flush_reset_perms(hdr); */
	struct vm_struct *vm = find_vm_area_ind((void *)hdr);

	if (vm)
		vm->flags |= VM_FLUSH_RESET_PERMS;

	if (run_CVE_2021_33909) {
		hdr->image[8] = 0x13;
		hdr->image[9] = 0x37;
		hdr->image[10] = 0x13;
		hdr->image[11] = 0x37;
		pr_info("LOCK RO HERE!\n");
		run_CVE_2021_33909 = 0;
	}

	set_mem_ro((unsigned long)hdr, hdr->size >> PAGE_SHIFT);
	set_mem_x((unsigned long)hdr, hdr->size >> PAGE_SHIFT);
}

Hmm, I thought the write faults on allocated pages were from other types
of data, but maybe I made a mistake here, and it was actually other
`struct file`. This is good to know if true, thank you.

The above were super valuable! One insight that I've had, related to the
third link above is that if you do have a lock/unlock tracking based on
allocation/deallocation (the second link, or my file tracking from the
last email), you can get a KASAN-like UAF tracking, since if you see a
fault from a PC on a resource which has already trapped into the "free"
handler (and no corresponding alloc), then this can trip a fault.

Essentially, a hashmap tracking each page and associating it to the
current kmalloc type... but I think SLAB_VIRTUAL also achieves this by
preventing te reuse of that virtual page.

Absolutely, from the above, I still have some concerns and see some
limits to these approaches, but your insight that alloc_tag.h can be
used for type tracking and security is valuable, and maybe I can see if
Google can enable it for Android 16 (if they have not already).

Similar case to the other patches, I didn't see much response, so did
not think I should really petition too hard for the changes, though they
are valuable for PXNTable enforcement.

I suppose no response to a patch does not mean it is dead.

Only x86. I supposed the BPF maintainers would integrate my ARM change
coalescing via other means. I have not checked back, but will ping the
BPF list again if there's still the *_handler CFI bypasses in more
recent kernels.
