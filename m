I think you mean authenticity, not integrity?

Also how does this differ from IMA?  I know that IMA doesn't support fs-verity
file hashes, but that could be changed.  Why not extend IMA to cover your use
case(s)?

Do you have a better example?  This one is pretty useless since one can get
around it just by executing a file that doesn't have fs-verity enabled.

No, it's not.

Digests are meaningless without knowing what algorithm they were created with.

If your security policy is something like "Trust the file with digest $foo" and
multiple hash algorithms are possible, then the alorithm intended to be used
needs to be explicitly specified.  Otherwise any algorithm with the same length
digest will be accepted.  That's a fatal flaw if any of these algorithms is
cryptographically broken or was never intended to be a cryptographic algorithm
in the first place (e.g., a non-cryptographic checksum).

Cryptosystems always need to specify the crypto algorithm(s) used; the adversary
must not be allowed to choose the algorithms.

I'm not sure how these patches can be taken seriously when they're getting this
sort of thing wrong.

Most users of fs-verity built-in signatures have actually been enforcing their
security policy in userspace, by checking whether specific files have the
fs-verity bit set or not.  Such users could just store and verify signatures in
userspace instead, without any kernel involvement.  So that's what I've been
recommending (with limited success, unfortunately).

If you really do need in-kernel signature verification, then that may be a
legitimate use case for the fs-verity built-in signatures, although I do wonder
why you aren't using IMA and its signature mechanism instead.
