Thanks a lot James for looking at this proposal,
and sharing your thoughts. Really appreciate it.

Here we meant just truncating IMA log is not a complete
solution in itself. As you said, we have to take additional steps
like logging TPM2_Quotes etc. Logging AK is an interesting proposal
which we didn’t consider earlier. I am not sure if embedding AK to IMA
log/snapshot is needed. If the client sends them separately with "signed
PCR quotes" + "IMA log" + snapshots, it should still serve the purpose,
right?

A new IMA log snapshot file (or shard as you call it) will have
the TPM2_Quote record (plus some additional metadata) at the beginning.
I don't believe it needs to be logged at the end of the snapshot (since 
it can
be computed by replaying the remaining entries in the snapshot).

See the snapshot_aggregate field in section B.5 in the original RFC mail 
[1].

Could you please point to the Keylime source and/or documentation
which explains the use of beginning and end quotes? We would like to
understand how the verifiers are addressing this problem currently.
