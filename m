I may be in the minority here, but I see this issue as a significant
downside of making lockdown more flexible.  If we stick with just
"this may violate integrity" and "this may violate confidentiality",
then the ABI surface is nice and narrow.  If we start having a big
uapi list of things that might qualify for lockdown, we need to worry
about compatibility issues.

This isn't purely theoretical.  Lockdown has some interesting
interactions with eBPF.  I don't want to be in a situation where v1 of
lockdown has a few eBPF hooks, but a later update improves the eBPF vs
lockdown interaction so that you can do more with eBPF on a locked
down kernel.  But now any such change has to worry about breaking the
lockdown LSM ABI.

And I still think it would be nice to have some credible use case for
a more fine grained policy than just the tri-state.  Having a lockdown
policy of "may not violate kernel confidentiality except using
kprobes" may be convenient, but it's also basically worthless, since
kernel confidentiality is gone.

All this being said, I do see one big benefit for LSM integration:
SELinux or another LSM could allow certain privileged tasks to bypass
lockdown.  This seems fine, except that there's potential nastiness
where current->cred isn't actually a valid thing to look at in the
current context.


So I guess my proposal is: use LSM, but make the hook very coarse
grained: int security_violate_confidentiality(const struct cred *) and
int security_violate_integrity(const struct cred *).
