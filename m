This statement is absolutely true.

Kees Cook said there is no problem if the policy of assigning LSM ID value were

  1) author: "Hello, here is a new LSM I'd like to upstream, here it is. I assigned
              it the next LSM ID."
     maintainer(s): "Okay, sounds good. *review*"

  2) author: "Hello, here is an LSM that has been in active use at $Place,
              and we have $Xxx many userspace applications that we cannot easily
              rebuild. We used LSM ID $Value that is far away from the sequential
              list of LSM IDs, and we'd really prefer to keep that assignment."
    maintainer(s): "Okay, sounds good. *review*"

and I agreed at https://lkml.kernel.org/r/6e1c25f5-b78c-8b4e-ddc3-484129c4c0ec@I-love.SAKURA.ne.jp .

But Paul Moore's response was

  No LSM ID value is guaranteed until it is present in a tagged release
  from Linus' tree, and once a LSM ID is present in a tagged release
  from Linus' tree it should not change.  That's *the* policy.

which means that the policy is not what Kees Cook has said.

I'm fine if security_loadable_hook_heads() (and related code) cannot be
disabled by the kernel configuration.

Pasting https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/10/1/192 here again.

  Hell f*cking NO!
  
  You security people are insane. I'm tired of this "only my version is 
  correct" crap. The whole and only point of LSM was to get away from that.
  
  And anybody who claims that there is "consensus" on SELinux is just in 
  denial.
  
  People are arguing against other peoples security on totally bogus points. 
  First it was AppArmor, now this.
  
  I guess I have to merge AppArmor and SMACK just to get this *disease* off 
  the table. You're acting like a string theorist, claiming that t here is 
  no other viable theory out there. Stop it. It's been going on for too damn 
  long.

The situation with LKM-based LSMs is symmetry of that post.
Those who are suspicious about supporting LKM-based LSMs is nothing but

  "Presently, as all in-tree users are built-in, LSM does not need to support LKM-based LSMs."

. That's "only LSM modules which are built into vmlinux are correct" crap.

Not all LKM-based LSMs need to use security blobs. What the LSM infrastructure
needs to do is manage which callback is called (so that undo operation is possible
when something went wrong while traversing the linked list). Everything else can
be managed by individual LSM implementations.
