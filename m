Well that was the original intent of the filesystem when it was created,
but I guess it's really up to the LSM maintainers now what they want it
for.

knowing where to look should not be an issue, as that should be
documented in Documentation/ABI/ anyway, right?

It's just the overlap / overreach of using an existing filesystem for
things that don't seem to be LSM-related that feels odd to me.

Why not just make a cocofs if those people want a filesystem interface?
It's 200 lines or so these days, if not less, and that way you only
mount what you actually need for the system.

Why force this into securityfs if it doesn't have to be?
