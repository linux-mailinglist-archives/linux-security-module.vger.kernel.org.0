It would have been really nice if the developers of resource namespaces
had addressed the "LSM question" when they created their schemes. But
they didn't. Namespaces are not primarily security constructs. You need
go no further than the group access problem of user namespaces to
understand where security ranks on the priority of namespaces.

The 45 years of experience we have had with building systems at every
level from network appliances, through user interface engines and multi-level
secure supercomputers convince us that workload based controls can never
provide anything beyond grandiose security theater. We have often claimed that
isolation (partitioning, if you prefer) is easy, sharing is hard. Building
a system security policy based on alleged "safe" existing behavior is at best
naive.

Resource namespaces are expensive and require extensive administration
to be useful. As one of the early developers of the inode label based
solutions you disparage so flippantly, I take umbrage with your
characterization of the design process. Of course we thought of features
which closely resemble user namespaces. They're great for isolation.
They're not so great for implementing fixed security policy, which was
the requirement and goal.

So long as the "environments" are completely isolated this makes
perfect sense. What so many "users", and more importantly, software
snake oil salesmen, seem incapable of coming to grips with, is that
for an "environment" to be useful it is going to do some amount of
resource sharing with the host and frequently with other "environments".
That is where the lofty claims of isolation fall apart, and the real,
painful work for security developers, begins.

	I have discovered a truly marvelous patch for this, which this
	email is too brief to contain.

All kidding aside, there are a bunch of things we could do, but they all
introduce issues with object sharing.

Evidence would indicate this is an errant conclusion.

Ever hear of the "Hillbilly Hummer"? No, you don't leave security policy

You really have missed the point. By a long way. The problem of security
is not now, nor has it ever been, isolation. It is sharing. If it is
appropriate for "users" to determine sharing, we have mode bits. If it is
appropriate for "administrators" to determine sharing, we have mandatory
access controls and namespaces. If sharing is completely inappropriate,
we have virtualization.
