Thanks for the feedback, Mickaël!

See some proposals for rephrasings inline. I tried to avoid passive
voice to make it easier to follow. Please let me know what you think.

(Any native English speakers are more than welcome to chime in as well. 8-))

I find that sentence confusing as well, but the "reparenting a file"
part is not the confusing part to me.

Proposal for this paragraph:

  This access right is available since the second version of the
  Landlock.  This is also the only access right which is implicitly
  handled by any ruleset, even if the right is not specified at the
  time of creating the ruleset.  So by default, Landlock will deny
  linking and reparenting files between different directories, and
  only grant this right when it is explicitly permitted to a directory
  by adding a rule.

  When using the first Landlock ABI version, Landlock will always deny
  the reparenting of files between different directories.

Proposal for this paragraph:

  In addition to the source and destination directories having the
  %LANDLOCK_ACCESS_FS_REFER access right, the attempted link or rename
  operation must meet the following constraints:

Both valid points. How about the following phrasing which is
formulated a bit closer to the actual goal (not creating a loophole
through which you can gain more access rights for a file):

  * The reparented file may not attain more access rights in the
    destination directory than it previously had in the source
    directory.  If this is attempted, the operation results in an
    ``EXDEV`` error.

+1, I reformulated that too above.

Done.
