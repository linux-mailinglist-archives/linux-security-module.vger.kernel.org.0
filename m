Hi Mimi,

This copy may be better.


subject: ima: fix deadlock when iterating over the init "ima_rules" list.



When traversing back to head, the init "ima_rules" list can't exit
iterating if "ima_rules" has been updated to "ima_policy_rules".
It causes soft lockup and RCU stalls. So we can introduce a duplicate
of "ima_rules" for each "ima_rules" list loop.

Signed-off-by: liqiong <liqiong@nfschina.com>

 This problem can happen in practice: updating the IMA policy
 in the boot process while systemd-services are being checked.
