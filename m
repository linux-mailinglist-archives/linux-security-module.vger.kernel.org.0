That was my impression based on your previous comments, my opinion
remains unchanged.

Just because it requires configuration and/or a way of maintaining log
information over a period of time does not mean it "cannot" be done.
I also suspect that the number of well managed, and properly updated
systems that have uptimes over a year are increasingly rare.  Yes,
there are systems with uptimes much longer than that, but my argument
is that those systems are not likely as security focused as they may
claim.

Thank you for your input.  It is clear that we have different opinions
on this matter.

Arguably your choice to reintroduce arguments you have previously
made, which I believe I've answered, is also not helpful, yet here we
are.
