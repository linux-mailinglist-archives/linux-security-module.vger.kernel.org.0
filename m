Subject: [PATCH v3 0/5] landlock: Pathname-based UNIX connect() control

Hello!

This patch set introduces a filesystem-based Landlock restriction
mechanism for connecting to UNIX domain sockets (or addressing them
with sendmsg(2)).  It introduces the filesystem access right
LANDLOCK_ACCESS_FS_RESOLVE_UNIX.

For the connection-oriented SOCK_STREAM and SOCK_SEQPACKET type
sockets, the access right makes the connect(2) operation fail with
EACCES, if denied.

SOCK_DGRAM-type UNIX sockets can be used both with connect(2), or by
passing an explicit recipient address with every sendmsg(2)
invocation.  In the latter case, the Landlock check is done when an
explicit recipient address is passed to sendmsg(2) and can make
sendmsg(2) return EACCES.  When UNIX datagram sockets are connected
with connect(2), a fixed recipient address is associated with the
socket and the check happens during connect(2) and may return EACCES.

== Motivation

Currently, landlocked processes can connect to named UNIX sockets
through the BSD socket API described in unix(7), by invoking socket(2)
followed by connect(2) with a suitable struct sockname_un holding the
socket's filename.  This is a surprising gap in Landlock's sandboxing
capabilities for users (e.g. in [1]) and it can be used to escape a
sandbox when a Unix service offers command execution (various such
scenarios were listed by Tingmao Wang in [2]).

The original feature request is at [4].

== Alternatives and Related Work

=== Alternative: Use existing LSM hooks

We have carefully and seriously considered the use of existing LSM
hooks, but still came to the conclusion that a new LSM hook is better
suited in this case:

The existing hooks security_unix_stream_connect(),
security_unix_may_send() and security_socket_connect() do not give
access to the resolved filesystem path.

* Resolving the filesystem path in the struct sockaddr_un again within
  a Landlock would produce a TOCTOU race, so this is not an option.
* We would therefore need to wire through the resolved struct path
  from unix_find_bsd() to one of the existing LSM hooks which get
  called later.  This would be a more substantial change to af_unix.c.

The struct path that is available in the listening-side struct sock is
can be read through the existing hooks, but it is not an option to use
this information: As the listening socket may have been bound from
within a different namespace, the path that was used for that can is
in the general case not meaningful for a sandboxed process.  In
particular, it is not possible to use this path (or prefixes thereof)
when constructing a sandbox policy in the client-side process.

Paul Moore also chimed in in support of adding a new hook, with the
rationale that the simplest change to the LSM hook interface has
traditionally proven to be the most robust. [11]

More details are on the Github issue at [6] and on the LKML at [9].

The most comprehensive discussion happened in a discussion started in
the V2 review by Christian Brauner [10], where we have further
explored the approach of reusing the existing LSM hooks but still
ended up leaning on the side of introducing a new hook, with Paul
Moore and me (gnoack) arguing for that option.

=== Related work: Scope Control for Pathname Unix Sockets

The motivation for this patch is the same as in Tingmao Wang's patch
set for "scoped" control for pathname Unix sockets [2], originally
proposed in the Github feature request [5].

In my reply to this patch set [3], I have discussed the differences
between these two approaches.  On the related discussions on Github
[4] and [5], there was consensus that the scope-based control is
complimentary to the filesystem based control, but does not replace
it.  Mickael's opening remark on [5] says:

> This scoping would be complementary to #36 which would mainly be
> about allowing a sandboxed process to connect to a more privileged
> service (identified with a path).

== Credits

The feature was originally suggested by Jann Horn in [7].

Tingmao Wang and Demi Marie Obenour have taken the initiative to
revive this discussion again in [1], [4] and [5] and Tingmao Wang has
sent the patch set for the scoped access control for pathname Unix
sockets [2].

Justin Suess has sent the patch for the LSM hook in [8] and
subsequently through this patch set.

Ryan Sullivan has started on an initial implementation and has brought
up relevant discussion points on the Github issue at [4] that lead to
the current approach.

Christian Brauner and Paul Moore have contributed to the design of the
new LSM hook, discussing the tradeoffs in [10].

 * Sample tool: Add new UNIX lookup access rights to ACCESS_FILE

Changes in V2:
 * Send Justin Suess's LSM hook patch together with the Landlock
   implementation
 * LSM hook: Pass type and flags parameters to the hook, to make the
   access right more generally usable across LSMs, per suggestion from
   Paul Moore (Implemented by Justin)
 * Split the access right into the three types of UNIX domain sockets:
   SOCK_STREAM, SOCK_DGRAM and SOCK_SEQPACKET.
 * selftests: More exhaustive tests.
 * Removed a minor commit from V1 which adds a missing close(fd) to a
   test (it is already in the mic-next branch)
