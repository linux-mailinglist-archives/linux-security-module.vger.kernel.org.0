Aah, right through tpm_tis_read32/write32(). This is definitely a new
regression. Thanks for reporting this! This was completely missed when
the support for other than TCG MMIO was implemented for the TIS driver.

This should have a patch of it own with your reported-by unless you
care to send bug fix for it.

I cannot recall all the nyances related to interrupt probing but with a
quick look I wonder why it does not utilize int_queue. Then
tpm_chip_stop() could be done synchronously.
