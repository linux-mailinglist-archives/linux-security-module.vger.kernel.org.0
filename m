For this response I'll just discuss around the bullets brought up.
I need more time with seqlock solution.

What I did pick from your patch is that I'll revert the name of the
helper function back to key_gc_unused_keys() because I think it is
not senseful rename (only adds unneeded delta).

In this v3, true, the processing is broken, as pages with usage at zero
go also go through "gc state machine" (or whatever you want to call the
key type teardown process).

How my solution could be improved to address these concerns for the most
part, would be to do this in the beginning of each iteration:

	if (!refcount_inc_not_zero(&key->usage))
		goto skip_dead_key;

And after processing: call key_put() (essentially open-coded
kref_get_unless_zero).

This would guarantee that the traversal keeps it hands off from pages
with usage reduced to zero, wouldn't it?

If this is added to the patch, I don't really see how this patch would
break the causality i.e., order of how things are executed in the
garbage collection flow.

BR, Jarkko
