Agreed. I wouldn't consider anything else than the TPM in the IMA
measurement list context. The anchoring mechanism mentioned above
pertained to the possible extensions of the TPM anchor in the
containerized environment, like the vTPM.

The container has no impact on the measurement list entries other than the
ones related to the processes running within the container. This in turn,
the same as for the original IMA, is defined by the (container's) policy,
loaded on the container's creation.
