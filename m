Thank you for providing the example.  We've spent quite a bit of time
discussing CA keys stored in the MOK db being the new root(s) of trust.
While other certificates signed by the new root(s) of trust would be
added to the secondary or IMA keyrings.

At this point, the patch descriptions, and probably code, are written
in terms of CA keys stored in the MOK db, which the self signed
certificate restriction does not require.  With this design, these self
signed certs may be loaded directly onto the IMA keyring.  That's a
problem.  To fix the discrepancy between the cover letter, patch
descriptions and code, all that is needed is to verify that the self-
signed cert is in fact a CA.

thanks,

Mimi
