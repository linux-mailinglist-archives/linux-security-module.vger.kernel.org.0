Why doing the check only in the parent and reporting back the result to
the child could be a security issue?  I guess duplicating the check
would just avoid executing useless code in the parent side if the child
doesn't have enough privileges right?

I'll let you handle the new design of the hook, but I'll review it. :)

I guess we're not OK to tie the KEYCTL_SESSION_TO_PARENT call to a
ptrace_may_access() mainly because of the Yama case?  I'm wondering if
we should add an exception for Yama here, or if each LSM should
implement its own new hook with the related new bit of security policy.
I guess some systems with a fine-tuned SELinux policy could be an issue
too.

Anyway, I wondering what was the motivation to only/mainly check
EUID/EGID for keyring change.
