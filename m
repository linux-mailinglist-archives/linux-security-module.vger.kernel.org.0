The issue of namespacing LSMs is independent of stacking.

I remain unconvinced that namespacing should be done at the LSM layer;
my opinion is that namespacing should be handled individually by the
LSMs.  Just as there is no single security model across LSMs, I don't
believe there should be a single approach to namespacing.

The concept of loading a separate SELinux policy into a container, and
having that policy apply only to that container, is not currently
possible.  Of course there are ways to introduce additional security
domains within the container with SELinux, but that requires
cooperation between the container and the host.  There are also
several different approaches available today for isolating containers
with SELinux, which tends to fit very well with most container
workloads, but I get the impression that is not what Leesoo is
interested in at the moment.
