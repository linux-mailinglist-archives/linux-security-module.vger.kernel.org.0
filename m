move_mount() doesn't create a new mount it just moves an already
existing mount around in the tree. Either that mount is moved
(fsmount(), open_tree(OPEN_TREE_CLONE)) from it's source location or it
was a detached mount to begin with.

The new mount api splits mounting across multiple system calls. And the
state it keeps for itself is gone once you create a mount via fsmount().
Because then the fs_context will be destroyed and you're only dealing
with a superblock and mount(s) for it.

You shouldn't care about move_mount() moving a detached mount because
really it is not a move from some other filesystem location. The
creation of that mount will have already happened in
open_tree(OPEN_TREE_CLONE) or in fsmount(). So that ship has sailed and
move_mount() is the wrong place to do this.

If the only thing that would be broken here is that you want to block
moving mounts from a given source location then you need to pass down
that this is an actual move to the LSM hook. Because I'm really not keen
on giving LSMs access to is_anon_ns() or similar helpers. They're just
too easy to misuse.

For a 1:1 mapping of AppArmor LSM rules from the old to the new mount
api I expect that one will have to effectively redo everything
internally and keep state across multiple system calls. IMO, this is
really not the way to go. Instead it's probably wise to have a new mount
mediation policy for the new mount api with different semantics. Because
I have my doubts that a 1:1 mapping will even work and won't just cause
you CVEs.
