That thread mentions tune2fs utility that does this now.

My understanding is that only possible to enable these 3 levels:
https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v6.3-rc3/source/security/lockdown/lockdown=
.c#L19
and we want something in-between "none" and "integrity".

This will work for testing scenarios, but I was worried about production.
It's not supposed to be enabled in production builds, so making it
available can open the door for misconfiguration.
