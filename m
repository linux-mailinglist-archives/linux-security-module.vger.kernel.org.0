Looks mostly good at first glance. I left comments for some minor
stuff I noticed.

Technically it would be possible, for example with SELinux if the
audit daemon is dead. Not a likely situation, but I agree it's better
to be safe.

That would also run into the conundrum of holding a lock while
(potentially) calling into the LSM subsystem. And would it even fix
the information leak? Unless I'm missing something it would only
prevent a leak of the trusted xattr count, but not the presence of any
trusted xattr.

Yes, I can't see any reason why that wouldn't be the best solution.
Why haven't I thought of that? :)

I guess you will want to submit a patch for it along with your
rhashtable patch to avoid a conflict? Or would you like me to submit
it separately?
