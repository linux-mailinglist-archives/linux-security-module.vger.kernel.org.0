We have been shipping, and more importantly maintaining in the wild,
systems with a namespaced IMA implementation for 4+ years now. We
presented the foundations for all of this at the 2015 Linux Security
Summit in Seattle.

For the purposes of further conversation, I should clarify and
indicate that we have been shipping and maintaining what a namespaced
IMA implementation turns into when all of the engineering challenges
have been addressed with respect to workability issues, particularly
in regards to keeping the resultant system from being too fragile to
be effectively deployed and maintained.

If practical experience is worth anything, I don't believe that
namespacing the current IMA implementation is the optimum path
forward.  With respect to developing operationally relevant trusted
platforms, the objective needs to be modeling the behavior of
namespaces spawned from a known root behavior.

The current IMA implementation provides a great deal of relevant
infrastructure, but as these conversations have suggested, namespacing
the current implementation is problematic given how entangled it has
become with existing kernel infrastructure.  What is needed is
something far simpler that delegates, on the basis of a namespace,
security policy to something other then the kernel, consistent with
what we have learned about policy over the last 29+ years of Linux
development.

With respect to roots of trust, I don't think TPM's/fTPM's, virtual or
otherwise, are going to be the relevant technology moving forward,
although they will be part of the picture.

Mimi has another post down thread that I will provide some more direct
reflections on all of this for whatever value they may have.
