Because there is a distinction between "supported" and "enabled" (as 
explained in the sample), let's make this message more generic. The 
additional strerror() output would then be enough to distinguish the 
error type.

"The running kernel does not enable to use Landlock"

This switch/case logic might be a bit confusing; let's explain it for 
this doc *and the sample code*:

FYI, I'll send a standalone patch to remove all contractions and get a 
more consistent documentation. Please, keep it this way.

Good!

nit: you can use a 80-columns limit.
