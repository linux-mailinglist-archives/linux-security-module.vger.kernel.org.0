Hi Mimi,

Thanks for the advice，maybe i should trim the message,
here is a new copy:


subject: ima: fix deadlock when iterating over the init "ima_rules" list.

The init "ima_rules" list can't traverse back to head, if "ima_rules"
is being updated to "ima_policy_rules". It causes soft lockup and RCU stalls.
So we can introduce a duplicate of "ima_rules" for each "ima_rules" list loop.

Signed-off-by: liqiong <liqiong@nfschina.com>

 This problem can happen in practice: updating the IMA policy
 in the boot process while systemd-services are being checked.
