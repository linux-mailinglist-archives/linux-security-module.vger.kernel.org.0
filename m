What about:
forbidden, which is also the case when using the first Landlock ABI.

"forbidden to the source file."

Indeed, the check is done according to the source file and compared to 
the potential destination file. For instance, the parent source 
directory may not allow to execute the source file, but the link will be 
allowed even if the destination directory allows file execution in the 
case of the execution right being tied to the (linked) file itself.

There is also the RENAME_EXCHANGE case when we need make and remove 
access rights in the source and in the destination directory, but it 
would probably confuse readers to specify that.
