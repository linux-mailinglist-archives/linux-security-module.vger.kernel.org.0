I have to admit that so far, I still failed to wrap my head around the
full patch set and its possible corner cases.  I hope I did not
misunderstand things all too badly below:

As far as I understand the proposed patch, we are "checkpointing" the
intermediate results of the path walk at every mount point boundary,
and in the case where we run into a disconnected directory in one of
the nested mount points, we restore from the intermediate result at
the previous mount point directory and skip to the next mount point.

Visually speaking, if the layout is this (where ":" denotes a
mountpoint boundary between the mountpoints MP1, MP2, MP3):

                          dirfd
                            |
          :                 V         :
	  :       ham <--- spam <--- eggs <--- x.txt
	  :    (disconn.)             :
          :                           :
  / <--- foo <--- bar <--- baz        :
          :                           :
    MP1                 MP2                  MP3

When a process holds a reference to the "spam" directory, which is now
disconnected, and invokes openat(dirfd, "eggs/x.txt", ...), then we
would:

  * traverse x.txt
  * traverse eggs (checkpointing the intermediate result) <-.
  * traverse spam                                           |
  * traverse ham                                            |
  * discover that ham is disconnected:                      |
     * restore the intermediate result from "eggs" ---------'
     * continue the walk at foo
  * end up at the root

So effectively, since the results from "spam" and "ham" are discarded,
we would traverse only the inodes in the outer and inner mountpoints
MP1 and MP3, but effectively return a result that looks like we did
not traverse MP2?

Maybe (likely) I misread the code. :) It's not clear to me what the
thinking behind this is.  Also, if there was another directory in
between "spam" and "eggs" in MP2, wouldn't we be missing the access
rights attached to this directory?


Regarding the capability approach:

I agree that a "capability" approach would be the better solution, but
it seems infeasible with the existing LSM hooks at the moment.  I
would be in favor of it though.

To spell it out a bit more explicitly what that would mean in my mind:

When a path is looked up relative to a dirfd, the path walk upwards
would terminate at the dirfd and use previously calculated access
rights stored in the associated struct file.  These access rights
would be determined at the time of opening the dirfd, similar to how we
are already storing the "truncate" access right today for regular
files.

(Remark: There might still be corner cases where we have to solve it
the hard way, if someone uses ".." together with a dirfd-relative
lookup.)

I also looked at what it would take to change the LSM hooks to pass
the directory that the lookup was done relative to, but it seems that
this would have to be passed through a bunch of VFS callbacks as well,
which seems like a larger change.  I would be curious whether that
would be deemed an acceptable change.

=E2=80=94G=C3=BCnther


P.S. Related to relative directory lookups, there is some movement in
the BSDs as well to use dirfds as capabilities, by adding a flag to
open directories that enforces O_BENEATH on subsequent opens:

 * https://undeadly.org/cgi?action=3Darticle;sid=3D20250529080623
 * https://reviews.freebsd.org/D50371

(both found via https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3D44575361)

If a dirfd had such a flag, that would get rid of the corner case
above.
