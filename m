Fair enough.  I personally think it is nice to have a brief discussion
of how userspace might use a kernel feature, but if you prefer to drop
that part of the design doc I doubt anyone will object very strongly.

That looks fine to me.

I imagine that should be trivial to implement and I can't imagine
there being any objection to that.

If we are going to have a record count, I imagine it would also be
helpful to maintain a securityfs file with the total size (in bytes)
of the in-memory measurement log.  In fact, I suspect this will
probably be more useful for those who wish to manage the size of the
measurement log.

I have no objection to that.  Would a total record count, i.e. a value
that doesn't reset on a snapshot event, be more useful here?

Of course.

What if the snapshot_aggregate was a hash of the measurement log
starting with either the boot_aggregate or the latest
snapshot_aggregate and ending on the record before the new
snapshot_aggregate?  The performance impact at snapshot time should be
minimal as the hash can be incrementally updated as new records are
added to the measurement list.  While the hash wouldn't capture the
TPM state, it would allow some crude verification when reassembling
the log.  If one could bear the cost of a TPM signing operation, the
log digest could be signed by the TPM.

I disagree about the snapshot_aggregate record being disjoint from the
measurement log, but I suspect Tushar and Sush are willing to forgo
the snapshot_aggregate if that is a blocker from your perspective.
Once again, the main goal is the ability to manage the size of the
measurement log; while having a snapshot_aggregate that can be used to
establish a root of trust similar to the boot_aggregate is nice, it is
not a MUST have.

You will note that Sush and I replied to Stefan two weeks ago.
