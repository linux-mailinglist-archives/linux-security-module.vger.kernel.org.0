VecSR - Vector Standard Render

VESA Standards : Vector Graphics, Boxes, Ellipses, Curves & Fonts :
Consolas & other brilliant fonts : (c)RS

SiMD Render - Vector Graphics, Boxes, Ellipses, Curves & Fonts

OT-SVG Fonts & TT-SVG Obviously Rendered in Direct X 9+ & OpenGL 3+
Mode & Desktop Rendering modes

Improve Console & TV & BIOS & General Animated Render

Vector Display Standards with low relative CPU Weight
SiMD Polygon Font Method Render

Default option point scaling (the space) : Metadata Vector Fonts with
Curl mathematical vector :

16 Bit : SiMD 1 width
32 Bit : SiMD Double Width

High precision for AVX 32Bit to 256Bit width precision.

Vectoring with SiMD allows traditional CPU mastered VESA Emulation
desktops & safe mode to be super fast & displays to conform to VESA
render standards with little effort & a 1MB Table ROM.

Though the VESA & HDMI & DisplayPort standards Facilitates direct low
bandwidth transport of and transformation of 3D & 2D graphics & fonts
into directly Rendered Super High Fidelity SiMD & AVX Rendering Vector

Display Standards Vector Render : DSVR-SiMD Can and will be directly
rendered to a Surface for visual element : SfVE-Vec

As such transport of Vectors & transformation onto display (Monitor,
3D Unit, Render, TV, & Though HDMI, PCI Port & DP & RAM)

Directly resolve The total graphics pipeline into high quality output
or input & allow communication of almost infinite Floating point
values for all rendered 3D & 2D Elements on a given surface (RAM
Render Page or Surface)

In high precision that is almost unbeatable & yet consumes many levels
less RAM & Transport Protocol bandwidth,

Further more can also render Vector 3D & 2D Audio & other elements
though Vector 'Fonting' Systems, Examples exist : 3D Wave Tables,
Harmonic reproduction units for example Yamaha and Casio keyboards.

*Application of SiMD Polygon Font Method Render
*3D Render method with Console input DEMO : RS

3D Display access to correct display of fonts at angles in games &
apps without Utilizing 3rd Axis maths on a simple Shape polygon Vector
font or shape. (c)Rupert S

3rd dimensional access with vector fonts by a simple method:

Render text to virtual screen layer AKA a fully rendered monochrome, 2
colour or multi colour..

Bitmap/Texture,

Due to latency we have 3 frames ahead to render to bitmap DPT 3 / Dot 5

Can be higher resolution & we can sub sample with closer view priority...

We then rotate the texture on our output polygon & factor size differential=
.

The maths is simple enough to implement in games on an SSE configured
Celeron D (depending on resolution and Bilinear filter & resize

Why ? Because rotating a polygon is harder than subtracting or adding
width, Hight & direction to fully complex polygon Fonts & Polygon
lines or curves...

The maths is simple enough to implement in games on an SSE configured
Celeron D (depending on resolution and Bilinear filter & resize.
