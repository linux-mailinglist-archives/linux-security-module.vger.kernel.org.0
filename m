A trust source provides the source of security for the Trusted
Keys.  Whether or not a trust source is sufficiently safe depends on
the strength and correctness of its implementation, as well as the
threat environment for a specific use case.  Since the kernel doesn't
know what the environment is, and there is no metric of trust, it is
dependent on the consumer of the Trusted Keys to determine if the trust
source is sufficiently safe.

Please add the following topics:

* Provisioning - the trust source's unique and verifiable cryptographic
identity is provisioned during manufacturing

(1) TPM

The unique and verifiable cryptographic identity is the endorsement key
(EK) or its primary seed.  A review of the generation of the EK and its
accompanying certificate is part of the Common Criteria evaluation of
the product's lifecycle processes (ALC_*).  See "TCG Protection Profile
for PC Client Specific TPM 2" (
https://trustedcomputinggroup.org/resource/pc-client-protection-profile-for-tpm-2-0/
).

(2) TEE

A protection profile for TEEs does not yet exist.  Therefore, the
provisioning process that generates the Hardware Unique Key is not
evaluated by an independent third party and is highly dependent on the
manufacturing environment.


* Cryptography

(1) TPM

As part of the TPM's mandatory Common Criteria evaluation, the
correctness of the TPM's implementation of cryptographic algorithms,
the protection of keys, and the generation of random numbers, and other
security-relevant functions must be documented, reviewed, and tested by
an independent third party evaluation agency.  It must meet the
requirements of FIPS 140-2, FIPS 140-3, or ISO/IEC 19790:2012. 

(2) TEE

Evaluations of cryptographic modules within TEEs are not required, but
some are available for specific implementations within TEEs.


* Interfaces and APIs

(1) TPM

 TPMs have well-documented, standardized interfaces and APIs.

(2) TEE

Unless TEEs implement functionality such as a virtual TPM, they have
custom interfaces and APIs. 


* Threat model

The strength and appropriateness of TPMs and TEEs for a given purpose
must be assessed when using them to protect security-relevant data.

New keys are created from random numbers generated in the trust source.
They are encrypted/decrypted using a child key in the storage key
hierarchy.  Encryption and decryption of the child key must be
protected by a strong access control policy within the trust source.

Thank you,

Elaine (and Mimi)
