So from the above, can it be assumed that the RPM parsing code isn't
useful until the RPM packages contain fsverity root hashes?

In addition, and we mentioned this previously in this thread, it seems
that one needs to 'eat' a full read of a file, at least once, in order
to generate an fsverity digest that is consistent with the actual
on-disk contents of the file.

So, once again, the notion of the implementation of a generic digest
cache would seem to be orthogonal to the issue of verifying that the
digest values in the cache are from a 'known good' source.

We mentioned this previously in the related threads you cite, our TSEM
LSM implementation allows the kernel to determine whether or not a
userspace process or the entirety of userspace should be 'trusted' at
any point in time.

The security footprint/model of a digest 'priming' workload is going
to be extremely small.  If the priming workload is invoked early in
the boot process the kernel can have assurance that neither the
priming workload or the surrounding userspace has commited any actions
that would be considered to make the system untrusted.

> What it would be the right way to proceed, in your opinion?

Alternatively, we had suggested previously that the RPM parsing code
may be a good candidate for implementation with a separate kernel
loadable module.  That places the parsing code in the kernel to meet
your security requirement and there is standardized infrastructure for
module signing that would ensure the integrity of the parser.

The module surfaces a pseudo-file through securityfs that userspace
can use to feed the RPM header into the kernel to drive the population
of the digest cache.  The parser only needs to be resident and
operative long enough to initialize the digest cache of a trusted
system and a kernel loadable module would seem to be consistent with
that model.

Once again, priming the digest cache with known good digests seems to
be an issue orthogonal to the implementation of the digest cache
itself.

We would be interested in knowing if we are misunderstanding the model
you are trying to achieve.
