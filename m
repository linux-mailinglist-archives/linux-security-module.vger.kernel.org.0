I've patches pending for extending trusted keys to wrap the key sealing
functionality of the CAAM IP on NXP SoCs[1]. I want the kernel to
generate key material in the factory, have the CAAM encrypt it using its
undisclosed unique key and pass it to userspace as encrypted blob that is
persisted to an unencrypted volume. The intention is to thwart offline
decryption of an encrypted file system in an embedded system, where a
passphrase can't be supplied by an end user.

Employing TPM and TEE trusted keys with this is already possible with
dm-crypt, but I'd like this to be possible out-of-the-box with
ubifs + fscrypt as well.

How about:

-  type "fscrypt-provisioning" whose payload is
+  type "fscrypt-provisioning" or "trusted":
+  "fscrypt-provisioning" keys have a payload of
   struct fscrypt_provisioning_key_payload whose ``raw`` field contains
   the raw key and whose ``type`` field matches ``key_spec.type``.
   Since ``raw`` is variable-length, the total size of this key's
   payload must be ``sizeof(struct fscrypt_provisioning_key_payload)``
-  plus the raw key size.  The process must have Search permission on
-  this key.
+  plus the raw key size.
+  For "trusted" keys, the payload is directly taken as the raw key.

+  The process must have Search permission on this key.

Thanks. I wasn't aware of the last one. I (re-)read them now. I hope
this mail manages to address the concerns.

Patch to fix that awaits feedback on linux-integrity[2].

The footgun is already there by allowing users to specify their own

raw key. Users can already use $keyid for dm-crypt and then do

  $ keyctl pipe $keyid | fscryptctl add_key /mnt

The responsibility to not reuse key material already lies with the users,
regardless if they handle the raw key material directly or indirectly via
a trusted key description/ID.

I care for trusted keys foremost, so I've no problems dropping the encrypted
key support.

Trusted keys support TEE and hopefully CAAM soon as well. I don't want my
userspace directly poking a DMA master.

In light of the extended justification above, do you want me to respin with
the proposed changes?

Mixture of reading emails predating key_id and misunderstanding the API.
key_id would be much cleaner indeed. I can change this for v2.

Thanks for your review.
