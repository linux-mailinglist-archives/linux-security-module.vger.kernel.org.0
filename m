Nit, your From: line of your email does not match your signed-off-by:
line :(

In the future, you should fix that up so that maintainers don't have to
do it for you...

Gotta love the name...

Anyway, if this is enabled, and clang changes the flag or drops it, does
the build suddenly break?

And does gcc have something like this as well, or does that have to come
in a compiler plugin?

thanks,
