Yeah, LSMs are not meant to be used from a kernel module. The data
structure is actually __ro_after_init. So, I am not even sure how you
are using it in kernel modules (unless you are patching this out).
And, if you are really patching stuff to get your out of tree LSMs to
work, then you might as well add your "custom" LSM config here or just
override this count.

The performance benefits here outweigh the need for a completely
unsupported use case.

You cannot do this because this is not evaluated in the preprocessor
and is used to generate the variable names. If you have a working
snippet of code, please share.

How is this an indirect addition? I am not following. The end goal is
that when the preprocessor runs MAX_LSM_COUNT is a constant number and
not an expression like (1 + 1 + 1) if you have ideas please share the
actual code.
