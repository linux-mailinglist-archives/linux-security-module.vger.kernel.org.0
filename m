I see this as similar to other decisions we have taken, e.g. on the
(in-review) socket type patch, we have also discussed at the time that
socketpair() should always be allowed, even though it creates sockets,
because this syscall only establishes IPC communication channels
within the same Landlock domain.

Admittedly, in this case it is a bit more clearly about the Landlock
domain boundaries, but still OK in my mind.  I think we are aligned
though, see my answer to your proposal below.

I am afraid that we don't have a better option.  Even if we only
introduced one of the two patch sets in its original form now, we
would have to introduce that implementation as soon as the other is
added.

In my understanding, the only thing in which our two proposals differ
is the order in which we introduce the
LANDLOCK_SCOPE_PATHNAME_UNIX_SOCKET and
LANDLOCK_ACCESS_FS_RESOLVE_UNIX bits to the UAPI.

As soon as both bits are added, our two proposals do the same thing.

My proposal (introduce LANDLOCK_ACCESS_FS_RESOLVE_UNIX first)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The reason why I have been arguing to introduce
LANDLOCK_ACCESS_FS_RESOLVE_UNIX first is:

(a) It is possible (which initially wasn't obvious to me):

    When implementing this, handling LANDLOCK_ACCESS_FS_RESOLVE_UNIX
    implies the LANDLOCK_SCOPE_PATHNAME_UNIX_SOCKET semantics(!), even
    when that bit is not exposed in the UAPI yet.  (When
    LANDLOCK_ACCESS_FS_RESOLVE_UNIX is handled, UNIX-connect always
    works within the same Landlock domain, even for the time when the
    scoped flag is not exposed in the UAPI yet.)

    That way, everything stays compatible even when the scoped flag is
    later introduced.

(b) When introducing LANDLOCK_ACCESS_FS_RESOLVE_UNIX first, the UAPI
    will initially only expose one of the two bits.

    This simplifies the UAPI because users initially do not need to
    deal with the fact that two bits in the UAPI "interact".

    We can still introduce LANDLOCK_SCOPE_PATHNAME_UNIX_SOCKET later.
    But the only ruleset-building feature for which this needed would
    be if we want to have rules that allow outwards IPC interactions
    with other Landlock domains.

    Possibility of YAGNI: I am not sure how certain you are that the
    speculative allowing-scope-access feature is needed; I mentioned
    it here only because it is an option we want to keep open.  If we
    end up *not* needing this feature though, we will *not need to
    introduce the LANDLOCK_SCOPE_PATHNAME_UNIX_SOCKET bit at all*,
    because LANDLOCK_ACCESS_FS_RESOLVE_UNIX can already do all that is
    needed.

The implementation of this approach would be that we would have to
join the functionality from the scoped and FS-based patch set, but
without introducing the LANDLOCK_SCOPE_PATHNAME_UNIX_SOCKET flag in
the UAPI.

Your proposal (introduce LANDLOCK_SCOPE_PATHNAME_UNIX_SOCKET first)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Upside: users won't be surprised if UNIX-connect within
  the same Landlock domain works, because the bit is there for it

* Downside: They'll have to understand that the FS bit implies the
  scope flag.



But as I said in the beginning -- if we add both flags, these two
proposals end up being the same in the end.

Maybe the main point that is unclear to me is what I called the
"Possibility of YAGNI" above: it is at this point not 100% clear to me
that the feature for allowing IPC to other domains is going to happen
(we don't have a bug tracker issue for it either, AFAICT).  So in the
case where this does not actually end up happening, I think that my
approach has the advantage of introducing one flag less, so the UAPI
stays simpler.

If you know that that feature will happen though, I think the two
approaches are equally good in the long run.

But either way, Mickaël, you are the maintainer here :); if you prefer
to do the LANDLOCK_SCOPE_PATHNAME_UNIX_SOCKET patch set in its current
form first, it's also OK with me.  As I said, I think these two
approaches are the same.


P.S. Tingmao: One additional complication, in case the
LANDLOCK_SCOPE_PATHNAME_UNIX_SOCKET patch set gets sent first -- your
current patch set uses a different LSM hook than the final state which
we are aiming for.  We may need to double check that this will stay
compatible even if we move the scoped-check into the new LSM hook in
the future.  (If we move the check into a different hook, there may be
some obscure scenarios in which a denied connect()/send() results in a
different error code.)  I may comment on the patch set.
