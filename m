Very good, we will look forward to the review of V2, which has now
been enhanced on a number of fronts.

All of the above is consistent with what we have used for years,
particularly 80 columns, given that the principles of TSEM extend from
programming with a Model 29 keypunch and a drum card to applying
machine learning to security.
