Just say "no" to hex encoding! BTW, keys are not hex encoded.

We've never had to think about having general rules on
what security modules do before, because with only one
active each could do whatever it wanted without fear of
conflict. If there is already a character that none of
the existing modules use, how would it be wrong to
reserve it?

Smack disallows the four characters '"/\ because quoting
is too important to ignore and the likelyhood that someone
would confuse labels with paths seemed great. I sniffed
around a little, but couldn't find the sets for SELinux or
AppArmor.

Agreed, even though there was a time when I could do
hex decoding in both ASCII and EBCDIC on the fly.

Unfortunately, I'm facing two options, one of which the
kernel maintainer thinks is a bad idea and the other the
user space maintainer thinks is a bad idea. Plus, I'm not
very happy with either, either.

I'm aware of this issue, which is one of the reasons I'm
asking about the preferred approach.

Point. But long term, they'll have to be updated to accommodate
whatever we decide on. Which makes the "simple" case, where one
security module is in use all the more important.

You move the parsing problem to the record, where you have to
look for subj_selinux=3D instead of having the parsing problem in
the subj=3D field, where you look for something like selinux=3D
within the field. Neither looks like the work of an afternoon to
get right.

It probably looks like I'm arguing for the Hideous format option.
That would require less work and code disruption, so it is tempting
to push for it. But I would have to know the user space side a
whole lot better than I do to feel good about pushing anything that
isn't obviously a good choice. I kind of prefer Paul's "subj=3D?"
approach, but as it's harder, I don't want to spend too much time
on it if it gets me a big, juicy, well deserved NAK.
