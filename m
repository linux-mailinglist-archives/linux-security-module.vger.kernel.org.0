My apologies, yes I am rather busy at the moment, but I also stopped
following this thread a while ago as it didn't seem to be going
anywhere meaningful.  I happen to read this last email while I'm
waiting in an airport, so let me try and provide a quick explanation
about why running SELinux only in a container is a bad idea.

As you probably know, the Linux kernel has no concept of a container,
it only supports subsystem specific namespaces, e.g. mount namespace,
network namespace, etc.  SELinux does not provide a subsystem
namespace, and it does not generally concern itself with other
subsystem names.  From a SELinux perspective there is no difference
between a process running in the host namespace or a
container/namespace; both are treated the same with access control
decisions made based on the processes' SELinux domain, the type of the
target resource, and the access requested.

If one were to load a SELinux policy inside a container, even if it
were allowed, the system would likely behave in unexpected ways as the
container-loaded policy will take effect across the entire system, not
just inside the container.
