There are ways to leverage the LSMs to apply finer grained access
control on top of the relatively coarse capabilities that do not
require circumventing those capability controls.  One grants the
capabilities, just as one would do today, and then leverages the
security functionality of a LSM to further restrict specific users,
applications, etc. with a level of granularity beyond that offered by
the capability controls.
