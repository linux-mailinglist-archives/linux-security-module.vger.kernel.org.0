Most pull requests certainly are proper starts of threads. And I
generally wish they were, because I know I myself tend to skim over
emails much more quickly if it's some old discussion that I either
consider solved or where somebody else is handling it, so if I see a
pull request in the middle of a thread, it's much more likely that I'd
miss it.

It does happen, though. Not just in situations like this, where I
replied to the original pull request with some reason for why I
wouldn't pull it, and then the fixed pull came in as part of the
thread.

Al Viro does that to me occasionally, for example. Some discussion
about a vfs problem, and then the pull request is in the middle of
that thread. You can see an example of that here:

     https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20180125002151.GR13338@ZenIV.linux.org.uk/

although in that case it was Davem who merged it (in merge commit 8ec59b44a006.

Of course, pr-tracker-bot wouldn't have noticed that one anyway,
because it also doesn't have "GIT PULL" or anything like that in the
subject line at all. So maybe it's not a great example.

I don't know if it's worth changing the pr-tracker-bot rules. I *do*
think that the whole unquoted

   for you to fetch changes up to [hex string]

is by far the strongest single signal for a pull request, but it's not
clear that it's worth spending a lot of CPU time looking for that
unless you have a strong signal in the subject line.

So I consider this "solved", and maybe people should just realize that
they won't get the automated responses unless they do everything just
right.
