Hi!

Thanks for sending this patch! I have overlooked to update this in the
original patch set.

Nit: The paragraph seems a bit long and is mixing more general
considerations with examples. Maybe they could be split into separate
paragraphs?

Regarding the "As a consequence..." example: I would word it as "...it
may be allowed to open a file for writing without being allowed to
ftruncate the resulting file descriptor...".

The example you are giving with creating files is also accurate, but
it is potentially confusing, because creat() and open(..., O_TRUNC)
are also implicitly truncating files when opening the file.

Regarding "The rationale is that this approach is simple and
consistent...": The word "simple" is often a sign that we could be
more concrete, and there is also a risk that a reader might not
perceive it as simple ;)  How about this:

```

The rationale is that equivalent sequences of operations should lead
to the same results, when they are executed under the same Landlock
domain.

For example, for the LANDLOCK_ACCESS_FS_TRUNCATE right, the following
sequences of operations are roughly equivalent and should have the
same result:

* truncate(path)
* fd = open(path, O_WRONLY); ftruncate(fd); close(fd)

```

(I think it's a bit more readable with bullet points, and the
truncate/ftruncate example might be a bit more familiar than the
somewhat unusual mknod?)

"May still be restricted" is leaving the reader a bit in the dark
about the exact circumstances where this might happen? I think we
could be more bold and give a guarantee here, like:

```

Access rights attached to file descriptors are retained even if the
file descriptor is passed between Unix processes (e.g. through a Unix
Domain Socket). The access rights will be enforced even if the
receiving process is not sandboxed by Landlock.

```
