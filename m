Hi Greg

I agree, it should not be needed.

I think the check above was just an optimization, but I agree you might
do other tasks, other than just filling the xattrs slot.

For me, it would not be really a problem to modify the code to invoke
the inode_init_security hooks with xattrs set to NULL.

I haven't found any counterargument, but will think some more.
