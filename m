I disagree that this is a policy engine in the kernel. It's a building
block for delegation and enforcement. The policy itself is implemented
in user-space by a privileged process that decides when to issue BPF
tokens and of which configuration. And, optionally and if necessary,
further restricting using BPF LSM in a more fine-grained and dynamic
way.

It would also be good to understand that yours is but one of the
opinions. If you read the thread carefully you'll see that other
people have differing opinions. And yours doesn't necessarily have to
be the deciding one.

I appreciate the feedback, but I don't appreciate the expectation that
your feedback is binding in any way.

Why can't distro disable this in some more dynamic way, though? With
existing LSM mechanism, sysctl, whatever? I think it would be useful
to let users have control over this and decide for themselves without
having to rebuild a custom kernel.

A bunch of people disagree with you.

"Patch things up using an LSM", if necessary, in a restrictive manner
is what LSM folks prefer. You are also assuming that it's always
necessary, and I'm saying that in lots of practical contexts LSM won't
be even necessary.
