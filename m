So there are two paths to getting an acl: 1) permission checking and
2) retrieving the value via getxattr(2).

This is a similar situation as reading a symlink vs. following it.
When following a symlink overlayfs always reads the link on the
underlying fs just as if it was a readlink(2) call, calling
security_inode_readlink() instead of security_inode_follow_link().
This is logical: we are reading the link from the underlying storage,
and following it on overlayfs.

Applying the same logic to acl: we do need to call the
security_inode_getxattr() on the underlying fs, even if just want to
check permissions on overlay.  This is currently not done, which is an
inconsistency.

Maybe adding the check to ovl_get_acl() is the right way to go, but
I'm a little afraid of a performance regression.  Will look into that.

So this patchset nicely reveals how acl retrieval could be done two
ways, and how overlayfs employed both for different purposes.  But
what would be even nicer if there was just one way to retrieve the acl
and overlayfs and cifs be moved over to that.

Thanks,
Miklos
