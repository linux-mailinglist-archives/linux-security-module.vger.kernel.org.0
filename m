With some applications, the indirection is important.   It allows the
"encrypted" key type to be updated/re-encypted based on a new "trusted"
key, without affecting the on disk encrypted key usage.

As much as I expected, directly using "trusted" keys is a result of the
new trusted key sources.  I have no opinion as to whether this is/isn't
a valid usecase.

Mimi
