Hi,

My v5.3 PR contains two critical bug fixes and support for obtaining TPM
events triggered by ExitBootServices(). For the latter I have to give a
quite verbose explanation not least because I had to revisit all the
details myself to remember what was going on in Matthew's patches.

The preboot software stack maintains an event log that gets entries
every time something gets hashed to any of the PCR registers. What gets
hashed could be a component to be run or perhaps log of some actions
taken just to give couple of coarse examples. In general, anything
relevant for the boot process that the preboot software does gets hashed
and a log entry with a specific event type [1].

The main application for this is remote attestation and the reason why
it is useful is nicely put in the very first section of [1]:

"Attestation is used to provide information about the platformâ€™s state
to a challenger. However, PCR contents are difficult to interpret;
therefore, attestation is typically more useful when the PCR contents
are accompanied by a measurement log. While not trusted on their own,
the measurement log contains a richer set of information than do the PCR
contents. The PCR contents are used to provide the validation of the
measurement log."

Because EFI_TCG2_PROTOCOL.GetEventLog() is not available after calling
ExitBootServices(), Linux EFI stub copies the event log to a custom
configuration table. Unfortunately, ExitBootServices() also generates
events and obviously these events do not get copied to that table.
Luckily firmware does this for us by providing a configuration table
identified by EFI_TCG2_FINAL_EVENTS_TABLE_GUID.

This PR essentially contains necessary changes to provide the full
event log for the use the user space that is concatenated from these
two partial event logs [2].

[2] The final concatenation is done in drivers/char/tpm/eventlog/efi.c
