Addressed at the end of this e-mail.

You can also see our reply to James Morris and the announcement of the
Linux Security Summit in Denver this summer.

For the record, we did bring a specific concern to the list for
discussion, you removed the question and example we raised from your
reply.

Let me re-state the example and question for the benefit of everyone
reading along at home.

An LSM encodes a description of each security event it handles that is
designed to be consumed by an application running in userspace or on a
dedicated device that analyzes the events.  If the application or
device detects an anomalous event or pattern of events it takes action
to protect the system.

Would such an LSM be permitted to exist?

If the answer to the previous question is yes, at what level of event
resolution can the remediative action be taken?

We will look forward to the ensueing discussion.

Since we seem to be on the precipice of closing down the discussion on
the relevancy of LSM development moving forward, a final comment for
the record.

We were not tilting at windmills when we started this effort two years
ago, we fully understood that we would be involved in a long game.

Our objectives were to either:

1.) Provide Linux security development with infrastructure for a more
generic and safer security modeling architecture that is consistent
with the current and emerging threat environment and counter-offensive
technologies.

or

2.) Document that upstream Linux security development is not a
suitable venue for analyzing and solving these and upcoming security
challenges.

Two outcomes were possible, either outcome was acceptable, the second
seems to be the one that is eventuating.
