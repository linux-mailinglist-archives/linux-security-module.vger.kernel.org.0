Comparing userspace applications to kernel code isn't a fair
comparison as a userspace application can generally be added without
impacting the other applications on the system.

Anyone is always free to build their own kernel with whatever code
changes they like, this is the beauty of the kernel source being
available and licensed as Open Source.  You are free to build a kernel
with whatever LSM you like included and enabled.  You have been shown
examples on how to do this in previous threads.

Anyone is free to build their own kernel with whatever LSMs they want,
either in-tree or out-of-tree; the static call changes do not prevent
that.

As mentioned so many times before, the "in-tree but not built-in" LSM
problem is entirely a distribution/binary-kernel problem.  The
upstream kernel community is not responsible for the choices and
individual build configurations of the different Linux distros.
Support for mechanisms which allow for dynamic LSMs in pre-built
distro kernels is something we could consider, but so far everything
that has been proposed has had a negative impact on the upstream
kernel sources and has been rejected as a result.
