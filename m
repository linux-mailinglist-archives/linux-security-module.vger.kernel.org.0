Wait, why are you using securityfs for this?

securityfs is for LSMs to use.  If you want your own filesystem to play
around with stuff like this, great, write your own, it's only 200 lines
or less these days.  We used to do it all the time until people realized
they should just use sysfs for driver stuff.

But this isn't a driver, so sure, add your own virtual filesystem, mount
it somewhere and away you go, no messing around with securityfs, right?

thanks,
