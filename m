Usually when you want this kind of information, you are investigating an=20
incident. You wouldn't place a syscall audit for every execve and then=20
reconstruct the call chain from that. In the case of long running daemons,=
=20
the information could have been rotated away. But typically you want to see=
=20
what the entry point is. A sudden shell from bind would be suspicious while=
 a=20
shell from sshd is not.
