The immediate concern was to fix the issue caused by the default
callback (bpf_lsm_secid_to_secctx) which affected even the users
who were not deliberately attaching a BPF program to the hook.

We can probably restrict attachment of BPF programs to be fexit trampolines
instead of fmod_ret by using some of the work that is being done for
BTF ID whitelists for the d_path helper. (fexit trampolines cannot
change the return
value of the default callback).

https://lore.kernel.org/bpf/20200616100512.2168860-9-jolsa@kernel.org/

With some of the optimization work which should remove this
default callback, we can also prevent the non-deliberate errors (the ones
that occur even when a BPF program is not attached to the LSM hook).
IMHO, these are more important to fix.
