Why is it not acceptable?  E.g. what specific use case do you have that
_requires_ on measuring partial 4k pages of an enclave?

SGX fundamentally works at a 4k granularity.  EEXTEND is special cased
because extending the measurement is a slow operation, i.e. EEXTEND on more
than 256 byte chunks, *with the current implementation*, would exceeded
latency requirements, e.g. block interrupts for too long and hose the
kernel.

A future implementation of SGX could change the latency of extending the
measurement, e.g. a different algorithm that is slower/faster, and so could
introduce EEXTEND2 which would work at a different granularity than EEXTEND.

EEXTEND could have avoided the latency problems via other methods, e.g. by
being interruptible a la EINIT and/or by being restartable.  But that ship
has sailed, so to avoid future complication in the kernel's ABI we're
proposing/advocating supporting only measuring at a 4k granularity.

It's not arbitrary, there are good reasons for wanting to work with 4k
granularity.  Regardless, there are many examples of the kernel arbitrarily
restricting what can be done relative to what is physically possible in
hardware.

Interoperability with what?  Other OSes?

Same interoperability question as above.

We've also discussed an EEXTEND ioctl(), but ultimately couldn't come up
with a use case that _required_ partial page measurement.
