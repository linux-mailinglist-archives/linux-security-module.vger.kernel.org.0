Yes, we're fully aware that extending the TPM PCR takes a long time.
 That is the reason for a lot of Nayna Jain's and my work on improving
the TPM performance.

At one point, I implemented queueing the measurements without waiting
for the measurements to extend the TPM.  The performance was
absolutely amazing, but not waiting for the TPM extend to complete
violates the trusted boot principle of measuring and extending the TPM
PCR before use.

Secondly, the IMA measurement list order and the order in which the
measurements extend the TPM is really important in order to be able to
validate the IMA measurement list against the TPM PCR quote.

One solution that we've considered is batching the measurements, so
that the TPM PCR is extended with the hash of the batched
measurements, instead of each measurement.  The IMA measurement list
would continue to contain the individual measurements, but would also
need to indicate start/stop of the batched measurement group.  None of
this is trivial.
