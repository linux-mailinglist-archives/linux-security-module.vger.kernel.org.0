If we look at the very next sentence in my last reply you see that I
acknowledge that there may be no callers that currently do that, but
it seems like an easy mistake for someone to make.  I've seen kernel
coding errors similar to this in the past, it seems like a reasonable
thing to protect against, especially considering it is well outside of
any performance critical path.

A couple of things come to mind ... First, the concern isn't the
existing caller(s), as mentioned above, but future callers.  Second,
while the kernel code review process is good, the number of serious
kernel bugs that have passed uncaught through the code review process
is staggering.

That's a pretty bold statement, good luck with that.

That's not the argument being made here, but based on your previous
statements of trusting code review to catch bugs and your opposition
to defensive programming it seems pretty unlikely we're going to find
common ground.

I'll take care of this in the LSM tree.
