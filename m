Yes.

For what the code is trying to do I can't fathom what was trying to
be accomplished by the "mismatched" uid/euid check.

Yes, nothing has changed from a security standpoint.

The concern with tracing is can the tracer gain more privileges from
the traced application.  If there is no switch of euid or egid the
answer is no.

In fact what we do is actively bad in the ptrace case as it makes
debugging unnecessarily change the behavior of an application.

That is a fair question.  Has some no-new-privs using application
that has uid != euid when it calls exec developed a dependency on
how we the code sets euid == uid when we call exec today.

That is exactly the case that Max Kellermann has a problem with,
so we have at least one no-new-privs user that wants the fixed behavior.

In addition to code searching we could first change the behavior for
everything except ptrace to just return -EPERM.  That should flush out
most of the users of this case if we miss some one.

Given that I have only seen a justification for limping along during
ptrace from Linus (and it was a long time ago) I think we would be
better off just making it fail, and then we don't have to worry
about userspace depending upon this weird case in future maintenance.
