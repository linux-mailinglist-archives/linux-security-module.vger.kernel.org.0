Excuse me? If the LSM community wants the assignment sequential, the LSM community
cannot admit the LSM value assigned to a not-yet-in-tree LSM.

If "Okay, sounds good." does not imply that the LSM community admits the LSM value
assigned to a not-yet-in-tree LSM, what did "Okay, sounds good." mean?
