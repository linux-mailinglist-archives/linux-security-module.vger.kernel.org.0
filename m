It simplifies but users can just ignore the bits for which they don't
care.  They just have to set the one they want (either scope or resolve)
and Landlock will do the right thing. :)

The only corner case is that setting scope_pathname_unix or not when
resolve_unix is set will result to the same restrictions.  In other
words, resolve_unix is a superset of scope_pathname_unix, so this scope
UAPI bit will be useless when resolve_unix will be introduced.

Indeed, I get your point.  Please add this rationale in the "Design
choices" section in Documentation/security/landlock.rst

Right, this looks good to me.  We'll need to sync both patch series and
remove the scope flag from UAPI.  I'll let you and Tingmao work together
for the next series.  The "IPC scoping" documentation section should
mention LANDLOCK_ACCESS_FS_RESOLVE_UNIX even if it's not a scope flag.

Yes, but this would be the same with your approach.  Not sure which one
would be the less confusing though.

As I said earlier, I'd definitely prefer to have an IPC-specific attr
instead of a generic scope attr.  So yes, this looks good to me.

You convinced me.  Let's go for the hybrid approach you proposed with
the implicit scope.

That's also a good point.  I'd be curious to know if this changes
anything, but it should not except maybe some error codes.

Anyway, we'll need this new LSM hook.
