I don't think it is common, and probably not acceptable, for the
kernel to open a file for writing.
 
As exporting the binary measurement list should be the equivalent of
displaying the binary measurement list and redirecting the output to a
file, the same mechanism used for displaying the binary measurement
list should be re-used for exporting it.  Just as carrying the
measurement list across kexec re-uses the same method.
