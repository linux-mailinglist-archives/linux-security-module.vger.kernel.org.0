Like Casey I'm not really excited about such a specific LSM hook, but
unfortunately we can't simply call kern_path() in the existing
security_sb_mount() callback as that could end up resolving to
something different than the call in do_loopback() which would be bad.
Moving the kern_path() call up into path_mount() just looks like a bad
idea anyway you look at it.  Unfortunately I don't really see an
alternative to what you're proposing, so I guess we're kinda stuck
with this as a solution, unless someone can think of something better.

I'm going to need to see an ACK from the VFS folks on this before I
merge the new hook.

I'd also stick with the security_sb_bindmount() name as opposed to the
XXX_path() suggestion from Casey simply to help distinguish it from
the pathname based LSM hooks.  Yes, this is operating on the pathname,
but bind mounts are a bit of a special case.

Unrelated, but I just noticed that we are calling security_sb_mount()
*before* may_mount(); that's the opposite order for most LSM hook
placements where we do the discretionary/capabilities checks first and
the LSM checks.  That's something we should look at, perhaps there is
a good reason for the ordering being different, perhaps it's a
mistake.

I might make a mention in the commit description that the
do_reconfigure_mnt() case (MS_REMOUNT|MS_BIND) should be able to be
handled using the existing security_sb_mount() hook.

I wouldn't mention security_sb_mount() above as that makes the comment
somewhat fragile in the face of changing hooks.  I would suggest
something along these lines:

"Beyond any general mounting hooks, this check is performed on an
 initial loopback/bind mount (MS_BIND) with the mount source presented
 as a path struct in @old_path."
