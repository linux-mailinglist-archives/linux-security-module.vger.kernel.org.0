Now that we have had some additional bandwidth to look at issues after
the first round release, it may be more straight forward to implement
the pollable files in securityfs than we thought.  We will take
another run at this and see what is possible without having to meddle
with the internals of securityfs proper.

As the diffstat for the patch series indicates, we spent considerable
time working to implement TSEM without touching anything outside its
implementation directory.  I think this is something that anyone who
has tried to upstream functionality into the mainline kernel would
understand the merit of.

Paul, I know you are busy, but if you can, weigh in briefly with any
thoughts you may have on where we put the control plane so we can
optimize everyone's time with the second spin of the patch set.

As an industry, we are in the middle of a software supply chain
security crisis.  In a trust orchestrated architecture, the trust
orchestrators, and their Sancho TMA implementations, are the most
security critical components on the system.  Our objective is to keep
the supply chain footprint for Quixote as small as possible.

To that point:

size /usr/local/lib/libyajl.so.2.1.1:
   text    data     bss     dec     hex filename
  33333     784      16   34133    8555 /usr/local/lib/libyajl.so.2.1.1

size /u/usr/sources/quixote-1.4/SecurityModel/EventParser.o
   text    data     bss     dec     hex filename
   2520       0       0    2520     9d8 /u/usr/sources/quixote-1.4/SecurityModel/EventParser.o

If we were to use JSON, we would use yajl, it is probably as light as
anything out there.  Given that, on face value, this would represent
over an order of magnitude increase in code size to achieve the same
objective, plus add an external dependency.

We can't claim to have dealt with varlink very much, but that actually
may make sense, down the road, given that TSEM can be conceptualized
as being about advertising resources that a client application needs
to provide a security service to the kernel.

Hopefully our concerns about software dependency issues make sense,
given the context that we wrote, and released, as part of Quixote, a
complete SGX Platform Software Implementation in order to avoid
exposing the SanchoSGX implementation to the 20+ shared library
dependencies that come with the Intel SGX software stack.

I'm not sure the audit system is a good fit for all of this, but I
will defer to Paul on that, given that he stewards over audit as well
as the security sub-system.

So, I was doing some thinking, while I was cross-country skiing for
about 10 miles across what the weather service is calling the glacial
icepack that is currently covering our wheat and soybean fields out
here in eastern North Dakota.

How about this for an idea, why don't we let the trust orchestrators
select the output format for the security event description interfaces?

We can start with the format that we are currently using and then add
things like varlink or other alternatives down the road.  That allows
different trust orchestration implementations to select what they feel
is the most desirable output format and doesn't lock the kernel into a
specific ABI format until we are actually covered by the next ice age.

Unless I miss my guess, in 25 years, if we have a reunion of trust
orchestration architectects, it will be pretty cheap to buy a round of
drinks, even if everyone is drinking 25 year old McAllen.

Paul, thoughts, given that if we move this to securityfs it will be
completely in your domain?
