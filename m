I am not opposed to conditionally returning ENOSYS. I also have no doubt
that doing so would break fewer applications, it will still break some.
As I said I will look into doing that

atm no, I am working on a conditional for detached mounts. I am not
convinced we should completely separate move_mount() mediation for
attached mounts.

But to use any of that you will need a new apparmor userspace to
support it. LXD is using the mounts as a behavioral/advisory catch, so
allowing an unmediated move_mount() is not the end of the world. Apparmor
still needs to be able to mediate mounts for applications that aren't
containers and do need a tighter barrier.

The reality with the new mount api is that atm we can only mediate
move_mount(), but the new mount api does add a twist with the whole
detached mounts. The only way to support that on older releases is
using a very generic mount rule.

New userspaces can pick up more. Leaving move_mount() unmediated even
for older releases really isn't an appealing option. New kernels
get pulled back and used on old releases all the time.

I am concerned about more than the snapd case, yes snapd could and
should use seccomp, but apparmor should be able to stand on its own
for other cases.

unfortunately that is always the case when fixing a mediation regression.
This one sat way too long that doesn't mean it shouldn't get fixed.

Overall though, I think lxd/incus is probably the major one. Most people
are running targeted policies and have left most of the stuff doing
mounts unconfined.

I am well aware of it. I fall on the side of leaving this completely
unmediated is slightly worse, but I can understand why someone
would choose to leave this unmediated.

sadly not for the move_mount() patch, it is however a one line patch

it would surfaced the via the regular securityfs/apparmor interface as

I could also get you a simple conditional patch around returning ENOSYS
to start testing, so that we could potentially try sending a final version
of that patch up next week.

I get what you are saying. The other side of the coin is oh look apparmor
isn't mediating mount if I just do this ...

agreed. That really should have been part of the patch to begin with.
