I won't say this is a great idea, or that I endorse it, but we could
allocate a range of LSM ID values ( 10000 - 10999 ? ) that we promise
will never be given to an upstream LSM. We wouldn't make any guarantees
about conflicts otherwise. These could be used by LSMs before they are
accepted upstream or by LSMs that don't have upstream aspirations. I
seriously doubt that anyone using such an LSM is going to be mixing
multiple such LSMs without being capable of managing ID conflicts.

Just a thought.
