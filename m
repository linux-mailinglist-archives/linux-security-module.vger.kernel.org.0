"the access control behaves like if domains not handling 
LANDLOCK_ACCESS_FS_REFER are in fact handling it and with their rules 
implicitely allowing such right."

Is this better?

"All rules within the ruleset/layer not (theoritically) handling refer 
operations". Layers handling refer-operations behave as expected and are 
not affected by this bug.

Yes, except for the rules correctly handling refer operations.

This is correct. In this case, the first landlock-restrict command 
behaves as the second command when the second is executed (i.e. a new 
refer-aware layer is added).
