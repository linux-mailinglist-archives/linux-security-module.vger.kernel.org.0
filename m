Thanks. No rush as far as I am concerned, although I suppose Chester
may want to rebase his arm64 IMA enablement series on this.

Suggestion: can we take the get_sb_mode() code from ima_arch.c in
arch/x86, and generalize it for all EFI architectures? That way, we
can enable 32-bit ARM and RISC-V seamlessly once someone gets around
to enabling IMA on those platforms. In fact, get_sb_mode() itself
should probably be factored out into a generic helper for use outside
of IMA as well (Xen/x86 has code that does roughly the same already)
