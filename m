I got it,  how about this:
  /*
   * The previous list has to traverse to new list,
   * Or there may be a deadly loop within
   * "list_for_each_entry_rcu(entry, ima_rules, list)"
   *
   * That is tricky, after updated "ima_rules", restore the previous list.

Sorry for the mistake, I copy/paste the patch and delete/edit some lines,
have reviewed before sending, but not found. I have made a case to reproduce
the error, dumping "ima_rules" and every item address of list in the error
situaiton, I can watchthe "ima_rules" change, old list traversing to the 
new list.
And I have been doing a reboot test which found this bug. This patch 
seems to work fine.

Yes, It's the workflow.

Yes,  "ima_rules" cache not update in time, It's a risk. I am not sure 
if "WRITE_ONCE"
can do this trick. How about:
     WRITE_ONCE(prev_rules->next, policy->next);
     WRITE_ONCE(ima_rules, policy);


If can't fix the cache issue, maybe the "ima_rules_tmp" solution is the 
best way.
I will test it.
