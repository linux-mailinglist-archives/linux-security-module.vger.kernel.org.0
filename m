FUSE would be a reasonable user space co-ordination implementation.  A
privileged process would trigger the snapshot generation and provide the
mountpoint to read the full IMA log backed by shards as needed by relying
parties.

Whether it is a privileged daemon or some other agent that triggers the
snapshot, it shouldn't impact the Kernel-side implementation.
