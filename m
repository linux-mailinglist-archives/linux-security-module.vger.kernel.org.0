I'll apologize up front to everyone else for this response, but I
hope it is something you might understand.

A security guard scans a person's access pass. As the computer system that
processes the data is slow, the guard lets the person go through the gate.
An access denial finally comes through. The guard turns and shoots the
intruder. What other choice is available? The intruder may have seen what
should not have been seen. Now the guard has to file a fatal incident report
and slow down everything else while cleaning up the remains.

tl;dr - async access control is just messy.

You are conflating issues. It isn't the purpose of the system, it is
the mechanism by which it is implemented that is the problem.

How can this possibly be a kernel problem?

Without insight regarding what these policies might be it is impossible
to say for sure, but I'll bet a refreshing beverage that they involve
all sorts of application level protocols, and other things the kernel
has no business moderating.

Oh, make no mistake, I (at least) understand how security is being
done these days and find it terrifying. We do in the kernel what can
and should be done in the kernel, but adding general supply chain controls
as an LSM isn't gonna happen in my (admittedly limited) lifetime.

Wow. The number and density of application and network protocols
necessary for that to work puts an Austrian pastry to shame. And
you want to put that in the kernel?

A one minute delay in an openat() call ain't gonna happen.

Remember "C2 in '92"? Executive order. Industry invested ~$25 Million
in 1990's dollars in evaluation costs alone. Never enforced. I am not
shaking in my boots.

When those technologies have developed some level of maturity and
acceptance they'll be worth considering more seriously.

I'm not discounting AI. I'm questioning it's use in kernel access control
implementations. You cannot ignore the impact of access control on system
performance. Ever.

Nah, it's about a Finish grad student's side project.

If you can demonstrate a sane implementation of your mechanism we're
all ears. User space policy adjudication isn't sane. It wasn't in the
1980's, it isn't now.
