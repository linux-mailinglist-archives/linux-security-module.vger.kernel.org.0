I understand the concern, that is why I left it up to the machine owner
to decide what they want to trust.  I took a quick look at a few other
distros, each one I checked (Red Hat, CentOS, Fedora, Ubuntu) all carry
this rejected patch [1]. These distributions have made the decision for
the end-user that they will trust platform keys for verifying kernel
modules.  With my change, it defaults to what the upstream maintainers
feel is an important trust model, but allows the end-user (assuming
they are the machine owner too) to override it.  This leaves the kernel
distributer out of the picture.

If the machine owner and Linux distributor are independent of one another,
I don=E2=80=99t see how MOK key signing could work.  There wouldn=E2=80=99t=

the kernel to verify the end-user supplied signed MOK key.  An end-user=20

a different direction to solve this problem.

I was referring to digital signature based IMA-appraisal.  If a company
wanted to ship a distro where all immutable files are IMA signed, today it
would not be feasible.  The end-user will undoubtably want to install their
own application, but this is not possible. The end-user can not IMA sign=20
anything since they do not have the ability to add their own IMA CA.
