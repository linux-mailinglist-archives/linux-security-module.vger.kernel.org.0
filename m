Adding the Landlock mailing list because it might be of interest for

Thanks for the document, it's a great overview!

Here are my though on the open questions (extracted from your document):

Indeed, seccomp-bpf would be the alternative to block some syscall 
families, but there is some issues using it. This is well explained in 
your blog post: https://blog.gnoack.org/post/pledge-on-linux/

I see two downsides for this proposal:

1/ That would require to know the exact future access rights names, 
which is not possible or would be too risky.

2/ If this is what you meant, using different flags in a user space 
library compared to the kernel interface would not be a good idea.

 From a kernel point of view, I don't want to just block context-less 
actions but instead I prefer to implement a way to control such actions 
according to their "objects" (e.g. file hierarchies, TCP ports, set of 
processes…).

However, for user space libraries, we could add a dedicated list of 
coarse-grained virtual access rights that will mainly cover these 
syscall families: chdir(2), truncate(2), stat(2), flock(2), chmod(2), 
chown(2), setxattr(2), utime(2), ioctl(2), fcntl(2), access(2) and 
rename/link. This list could be used to determine if the sandboxing 
should be applied or not. I'm still not sure how this could evolve though.

This may not be required though. Indeed, if the latest version of the 
kernel cannot allow some actions that are required by an application 
(e.g. create mount points), the developer of this application will just 
not use Landlock for now. When Landlock will handle this missing 
controlled actions, the developer can use the latest user space library 
that should nicely handle a best-effort approach for this action.

It doesn't answer all the questions but here is how I would handle 
compatibility issues with the Rust library: 
https://github.com/landlock-lsm/rust-landlock/pull/12/ cf. commit 
"compat: Switch from set_best_effort() to set_compatibility()".
There is three CompatLevel: BestEffort, SoftRequirement and 
HardRequirement. This enables developers to tune this library, if they 
want to, according to their use case.

Right

Yes please, that would be nice.
