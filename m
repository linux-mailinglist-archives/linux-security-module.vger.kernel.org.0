Patch 04/08 creates a new LSM hook, security_bpf_map_create(), which
when it returns a positive value "bypasses kernel checks".  The patch
isn't based on either Linus' tree or the LSM tree, I'm guessing it is
based on a eBPF tree, so I can't say with 100% certainty that it is
bypassing a capability check, but the description claims that to be
the case.

Regardless of how you want to spin this, I'm not supportive of a LSM
hook which allows a LSM to bypass a capability check.  A LSM hook can
be used to provide additional access control restrictions beyond a
capability check, but a LSM hook should never be allowed to overrule
an access denial due to a capability check.

The LSM layer predates CAP_BPF, and one could make a very solid
argument that one of the reasons LSMs exist is to provide
supplementary controls due to capability-based access controls being a
poor fit for many modern use cases.
