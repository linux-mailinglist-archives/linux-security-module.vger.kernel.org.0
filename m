I see now I did not reply to one of you questions - why I picked-up
 vlan, tunnel secmark fields to move them at sk_buff tail. 

Tow main drivers on my side:
- there are use cases/deployments that do not use them.
- moving them around was doable in term of required changes.

There are no "slow-path" implications on my side. For example, vlan_*
fields are very critical performance wise, if the traffic is tagged.
But surely there are busy servers not using tagget traffic which will
enjoy the reduced cachelines footprint, and this changeset will not
impact negatively the first case.

WRT to the vlan example, secmark and nfct require an extra conditional
to fetch the data. My understanding is that such additional conditional
is not measurable performance-wise when benchmarking the security
modules (or conntrack) because they have to do much more intersting
things after fetching a few bytes from an already hot cacheline.

Not sure if the above somehow clarify my statements.

As for expanding secmark to 64 bits, I guess that could be an
interesting follow-up discussion :)

Cheers,

Paolo
