As I mentioned previously, the main usage of this new keyring is that it 
should contain only CA keys which can be later used to vouch for user 
keys loaded onto secondary or IMA keyring at runtime. Having ca in the 
name like .xxxx_ca, would make the keyring name self-describing. Since 
you preferred .system, we can call it .system_ca.
