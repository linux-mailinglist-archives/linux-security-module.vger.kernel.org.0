My experience has taught me otherwise.

We don't currently support LSMs as dynamically loadable kernel modules
and if the only reasons for doing so are either to A) support
out-of-tree LSMs or B) avoid having to recompile a kernel (to hack an
unsupported LSM into a distro kernel) I have to say (yet again) that I
am not interested.

I thought my feedback has been clear up to this point, but perhaps I
need to be more direct.  At this point in time I am not interested in
supporting dynamically loaded LSM kernel modules if the only reasons
are to support out-of-tree LSMs or users who want to hack unsupported
LSMs into pre-built distro kernels; both of these use cases can be
solved today by compiling your own kernel.

As with the other threads involving this topic, I'm going to refrain
from any further comments until I see a new discussion point.
