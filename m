I'm referring to these:

https://lore.kernel.org/linux-integrity/20190329115544.GA27351@linux.intel.com/

I got response from you that those were applied and there is another
response in that thread that they are being sent to Linus. That is why I
haven't done anything since. Most of them are critical fixes to v5.1
changes.

Should I now take the action to send a PR to Linus and tag them to
stable?
