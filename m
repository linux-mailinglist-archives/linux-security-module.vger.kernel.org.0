Here, I meant user authentication to the trust source (TPM or a TEE)
which provides assurance for a key to be trusted. So what happens in
case of user-space compromises (an untrusted user gaining root
access)?

The major value add of trusted keys over user keys is this trust
assurance provided by the underlying trust source.

Along with that trusted keys assures protection against any

Agree and for that particular reason we are trying to add an
abstraction layer in trusted keys subsystem so that other trust
sources apart from TPM or TEE can be supported as well.
