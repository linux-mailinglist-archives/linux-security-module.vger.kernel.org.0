Hmm, why involve the TPM in kernel keyring population though, if all
keys in question are vendor keys used to sign OS resources, i.e. not
local keys? It's entirely fine to ship these keys along with UKIs or
boot loaders, and in the model where SB is off they are protected by
the measurements that are done of both boot loaders and UKIs.

And what would even install the keys into the TPM in the first place?

Also note, that while a TPM can store keys, the way it is designed is
that you actually store keys outside of it, but wrap them with the
SRK that is the one you do store on the TPM. This in particular
matters as people might want to boot kernels of multiple vendors at
different times on the same system, and hence the keys for that should
not be sticky in the TPM.

Sorry, but storing keys in the TPM for this is just wrong for my
usecase.

Sorry, but I vehemently disagree, that's a really broken security
model. SecureBoot on should mean strict rules and, SB off should mean
relaxed rules, and you are doing it in the opposite way.

This seems really strange to me, as no policy is enforced on the
nvindex? The TPM is not a magic device that sprinkles "trust" magic
dust on things: you have to define your objects with a policy that
locks down access based on attestation, pins or other stuff, and it's
just not obvious what that should be here for such a kernel keyring.

Sorry, but this all seems backwards to me: what you propose weakens
the current model afaics, and you insist to be strict in the case where
an explicit request has been made to relax things by turning off SB.
