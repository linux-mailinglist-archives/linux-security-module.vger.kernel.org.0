Hi Mimi,

Apparently I should not use "--from" in git-send-email command.

Apology for not expressed my intention clearly. The intention of this
patch is to add a space after printing LSM rules (if any) and the
remaining rules.

Currently, if I have a policy, for example:
appraise func=BPRM_CHECK obj_type=shell_exec_t appraise_type=imasig

The read back result is:
appraise func=BPRM_CHECK obj_type=shell_exec_tappraise_type=imasig

which is not correct.

I do not have a case for multiple LSM labels, but if there is one
such case, this patch will also apply.

I will post a v2 patch with tuned description.

Thanks,
Clay
