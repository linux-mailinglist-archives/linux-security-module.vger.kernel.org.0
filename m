Thanks Paul for responding and sharing your thoughts.


Hi Mimi,
To address your concern about pausing the measurements -
We are not proposing to pause the measurements for the entire duration
of UM <--> Kernel interaction while taking a snapshot.

We are simply proposing to pause the measurements when we get the TPM
PCR quotes to add them to "snapshot_aggregate". (which should be a very
small time window). IMA already has this mechanism when two separate
modules try to add entry to IMA log - by using
mutex_lock(&ima_extend_list_mutex); in ima_add_template_entry.


We plan to use this existing locking functionality.
Hope this addresses your concern about pausing extending the measurement
list.
