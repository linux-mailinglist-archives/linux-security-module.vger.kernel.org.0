There's more than one type of dance; this partially varies
depending on the system (SEV/TDX etc) and also depends on how you depend
to boot your VM (separate kernel or VM disk).   Also it's important to
note that when the dance happens varies - in SEV and SEV-ES this happens
before the guest executes any code.
So at the end of the dance, the guest owner hands over that secret - but
only then does the geust start booting; that secret has to go somewhere
to be used by something later.
For example, something might pull out that key and use it to decrypt a
disk that then has other secrets on it (e.g. your ssh key).
