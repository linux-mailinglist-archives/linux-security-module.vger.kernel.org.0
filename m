Yes please, if the current abi-*.h doc is not enough, please extend it.

This "How to check" subsection should be common to all errata.

This is correct but it should only be useful to a few programs.  We need
to be careful to avoid making developers feel that they should check
errata, whereas in 99.9% of cases it is not required, it increases
complexity, and potentially decrease protection if misused (e.g. if
erratum is not applied, a program could erroneously disable the sandbox
or some restrictions).  I think we should have a warning note to
highlight that (i.e. in doubt, ignore errata).

It's not related to the best-effort approach.

I like it too.  We should leverage the comments to avoid duplicating doc
though.
