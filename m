eBPF has been accepted because of these restrictions. Without them
an eBPF program could very easily reek havoc on the system's behavior.

This is of necessity. It is the only protection against malicious and
badly written eBPF programs.

Without this restriction denial of service attacks become trivial.

Yes. That's true for many kernel features.

To the best of my understanding, and I have been working with LSMs
and the infrastructure for quite some time, there has never been an
out-of-tree LSM API. We have been very clear that the LSM interfaces
are fluid. We have also been very clear that supporting out-of-tree
security modules is not a requirement. There are members of the
community who would prefer that they be completely prohibited.

You will need to provide more detail about why you believe that the
integrity of an AV/EDR product cannot be protected.

Security remains a dynamic technology. There are quite a few plans,
from a variety of sources, with no shortage of security goals. Trying
to keep up with the concern/crisis of the day is more than sufficient
to consume the resources committed to Linux security.

What APIs do you want? It's possible that some exist that you haven't
discovered.

And it will be for some time. That is, until it is mature.

Without specifics it is quite difficult to do anything about that.
And, as we like to say, patches are welcome.

Yes. Don't do that.

Please propose the interfaces you want. An API definition would be
good, and patches even better.

There are numerous cases where LSMs have mitigated attacks. One case:

https://mihail-milev.medium.com/mitigating-malware-risks-with-selinux-e37cf1db7c56

Your assertion that LSMs don't provide "real" value is not substantiated
in the literature.

Each of the existing LSMs addresses one or more real world issues. I would
hardly call any of the Linux security mechanisms, from mode bits and setuid
through SELinux, landlock and EVM, "theoretical".

We are always ready to improve the security infrastructure of Linux.
If it does not meet your needs, help us improve it. The best way to
accomplish this is to provide the changes required.
