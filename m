Hi Anirudh

I will rephrase this paragraph, to be sure that I understood it
correctly.

You are proposing a method to trim the measurement list and, at the
same time, to keep the measurement list verifiable after trimming. The
way you would like to achieve that is to keep the verification state in
the kernel in the form of PCR values.

Those values mean what verifiers have already verified. Thus, for the
next verification attempt, verifiers take the current PCR values as
starting values, replay the truncated IMA measurement list, and again
you match with the current PCR values and you trim until that point.

So the benefit of this proposal is that you keep the verification of
the IMA measurement list self-contained by using the last verification
state (PCR starting value) and the truncated IMA measurement list as
the inputs of your verification.

Let me reiterate on the trusted computing principles IMA relies on for
providing the evidence about a system's integrity.

Unless you are at the beginning of the measurement chain, where the
Root of Trust for Measurement (RTM) is trusted by assumption, the
measurements done by a component can be trusted because that component
was already measured by the previous component in the boot chain,
before it had any chance to corrupt the system.

In the context of IMA, IMA can be trusted to make new measurements
because it measures every file before those files could cause any harm
to the system. So, potentially IMA and the kernel can be corrupted by
any file.

What you are proposing would not work, because you are placing trust in
an input (the PCR starting value) that can be manipulated at any time
by a corrupted kernel, before you had the chance to detect such
corruption.

Let me describe a scenario where I could take advantage of such
weakness. After the first measurement list trim, I perform an attack on
the system such that it corrupts the kernel. IMA added a new entry in
the measurement list, which would reveal the attack.

But, since I have control of the kernel, I conveniently update the PCR
starting value to replay the new measurement entry, and remove the
measurement entry from the measurement list.

Now, from the perspective of the user space verifiers everything is
fine, the truncated IMA measurement list is clean, no attack, and the
current PCR values match by replaying the new PCR starting value with
the remaining of the IMA measurement list.

So, in my opinion the kernel should just offer the ability to trim the
measurement list, and a remote verifier should be responsible to verify
the measurement list, without relying on anything from the system being
evaluated.

Sure, the remote verifier can verify just the trimmed IMA measurement
list, but the remote verifier must solely rely on state information
maintained internally.
