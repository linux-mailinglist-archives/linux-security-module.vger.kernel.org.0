Mostly, there are just bind() and connect() related checks moved to
hook_socket_{connect, bind}.

I think I'd better move all refactoring-related fixes to a separate
patchset.

Sorry, it looks like patches created using the --break-rewrites option
of git format can only be applied manually. I'll try to split this patch
in v3 so that it can be applied automatically.
