I'll make the changes, rearrange the patches and send an updated set.

I do have a few questions since I am still not fully understanding the 
requirements you are targeting. Appreciate if you could please clarify.

As you already know, I am using the "public key" of the given asymmetric 
key as the "buffer" to measure in process_buffer_measurement().

The measurement decision is not based on whether the keyring is a 
trusted one or an untrusted one. As long as the IMA policy allows 
(through the "keyrings=" option) the key will be measured.

Do you want only trusted keyrings to be allowed in the measurement?
In my opinion, that decision should be deferred to whoever is setting up 
the IMA policy.

The decision to process key immediately or defer (queue) is based on 
whether IMA has been initialized or not. Keyring is not used for this 
decision.

Could you please clarify how queuing is related to keyring's 
trustworthiness?

The check for whether the key is an asymmetric one or not, and 
extracting the "public key" if it is an asymmetric key needs to be in a 
separate file to handle the CONFIG dependencies in IMA.
