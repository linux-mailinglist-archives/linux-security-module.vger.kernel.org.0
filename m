The suggested approach in this RFC discussion using a vfs_tmpfile was
only discussed but no prototype was created back then.  We are
discussing the approach internally now and will respond with more
details about it.

Noted, will do.

The main concern is the memory pressure on both the kernel and the 
attestation client
when it sends the request.  The concern you bring up is valid and we are 
working on
creating a prototype.  There is no intention to remove the exported 
measurements.
