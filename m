Except we are not talking SELinux or LSMs here, we are talking about
audit and the audit subsystem is very different from the LSM layer.
The LSM layer is designed to be pluggable with support for multiple
individual LSMs, whereas the audit subsystem is designed to support a
single audit implementation.  It is my opinion that the audit patch
you have proposed here does not provide an audit administrator with
any new capabilities that they do not currently have as an option.

There are also concerns around field formatting, record length, etc.,
but those are secondary issues compared to the more important issue of
redundant functionality.

From what I've seen, both in this thread as well as the other related
threads from you, these recent efforts are due to a lack of TOMOYO
support in mainstream Linux distributions.  My advice is to stop
trying to duplicate the TOMOYO functionality in other subsystems/LSMs
and start working with the distributions to better understand why they
are not supporting TOMOYO.  I believe that if you can determine why
the distributions are not enabling TOMOYO, you should be able to
develop a plan to address those issues and eventually gain
distribution support for TOMOYO.  I understand that such an approach
will likely be time consuming and difficult, but I think that is your
best option for success.

We've already discussed that in the TaskTracker thread.

We've already upstreamed an alternative approach to TaskTracker: TOMOYO.
