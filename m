Yes, but my point is that as soon as one or the other *denies* an
access, there is no need to check the other access type.

BTW, we should first check is_domain_scoped() because it is quicker than
the FS checks.

Indeed, if both deny the request, both should be listed.

Anyway, we're now going to only have one access flag that would merge
both semantic, so this should not be an issue.

However, this specific case will be relevant when we'll add e.g., a
signal attr that would then be complementary to the signal scope.  At
this point, I think it would be enough to only log the signal.* record
because it would be a superset of the scope.signal
