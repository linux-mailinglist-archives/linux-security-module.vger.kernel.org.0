Agreed. We discussed about making it more granular (see the IOCTL patch
series), but it is not worth it.  Even the directory/file
differentiation is questionable, but I initially made this decision to
incentivise user space to know if they are dealing with directories or
files because access right inheritance should be carefully managed.
In most cases, when programs sandbox themselves, they should not need to
stat the file because they should already know if it's a file or a
directory; only sandboxers need too check the file type.

Indeed
