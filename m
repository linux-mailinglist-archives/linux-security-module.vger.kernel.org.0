Well, if someone's being an idiot, that's on them and not something I'm
going to argue about :) Uidmapping has been around for plenty long
enough for userspace to start using it.

btree nodes don't change depth, so just recording the level of a node
and validating it trivially defeats that. bcachefs has that in its on
disk format, but if you don't have that then that might be a problem -
you'd at least need to know a priori the depth of the root node.

*nod*

In bcachefs, we right now have no way to cleanly detect "filesystem is
actually full, disk accounting info is wrong" so - that means corruption
causes allocations to get stuck. That one is fixable, and I'm going to
have to at some point since syzbot knows how to trigger it :)

Yeah, but that's the less interesting case to me. Not uninteresting,
since "I don't fully trust my block device" is a real scenario with
network attached storage. But generally, the tampering would be done by
the user that did the mount - so perhaps we need to find some new nudges
to make uidmapping of user mounts required?

That could be done in util-linux...
