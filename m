As I said above, the "encrypted" key update doesn't change the key data
used for encrypting/decrypting storage in the dm-crypt case, it just
updates the key under which it is encrypted/signed.

Yes, the reason for using an encrypted "trusted" key, as opposed to an
encrypted "user" key, is that the "trusted" key is encrypted/decrypted
by the TPM and never exposed to userspace in the clear.

It doesn't sound like you're wanting to update the storage key in the
field, just the key used to encrypt/decrypt that key.  So I'm still not
clear as to why you would want an initial non-random encrypted key. 
Providing that key on the command line certaining isn't a good idea.
