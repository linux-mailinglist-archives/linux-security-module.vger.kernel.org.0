This patch relocates the LSM hook function comments to the function
definitions, in keeping with the current kernel conventions.  This
should make the hook descriptions more easily discoverable and easier
to maintain.

While formatting changes have been done to better fit the kernel-doc
style, content changes have been kept to a minimum and limited to
text which was obviously incorrect and/or outdated.  It is expected
the future patches will improve the quality of the function header
comments.

- *	@bprm->cred->security to be what commit_creds needs to install for the

- *	The hook must set @bprm->secureexec to 1 if AT_SECURE should be set to
- *	request libc enable secure mode.
- *	@bprm contains the linux_binprm structure.
- *	Return 0 if the hook is successful and permission is granted.
- * @bprm_creds_from_file:
- *	If @file is setpcap, suid, sgid or otherwise marked to change
- *	privilege upon exec, update @bprm->cred to reflect that change.
- *	This is called after finding the binary that will be executed.
- *	without an interpreter.  This ensures that the credentials will not
- *	be derived from a script that the binary will need to reopen, which
- *	when reopend may end up being a completely different file.  This
- *	hook may also optionally check permissions (e.g. for transitions
- *	between security domains).
- *	The hook must set @bprm->secureexec to 1 if AT_SECURE should be set to
- *	request libc enable secure mode.
- *	The hook must add to @bprm->per_clear any personality flags that
- * 	should be cleared from current->personality.
- *	@bprm contains the linux_binprm structure.
- *	Return 0 if the hook is successful and permission is granted.
- * @bprm_check_security:
- *	This hook mediates the point when a search for a binary handler will
- *	begin.  It allows a check against the @bprm->cred->security value
- *	which was set in the preceding creds_for_exec call.  The argv list and
- *	envp list are reliably available in @bprm.  This hook may be called
- *	multiple times during a single execve.
- *	@bprm contains the linux_binprm structure.
- *	Return 0 if the hook is successful and permission is granted.
- * @bprm_committing_creds:
- *	Prepare to install the new security attributes of a process being
- *	transformed by an execve operation, based on the old credentials
- *	pointed to by @current->cred and the information set in @bprm->cred by
- *	the bprm_creds_for_exec hook.  @bprm points to the linux_binprm
- *	structure.  This hook is a good place to perform state changes on the
- *	process such as closing open file descriptors to which access will no
- *	longer be granted when the attributes are changed.  This is called
- *	immediately before commit_creds().
- * @bprm_committed_creds:
- *	Tidy up after the installation of the new security attributes of a
- *	process being transformed by an execve operation.  The new credentials
- *	have, by this point, been set to @current->cred.  @bprm points to the
- *	linux_binprm structure.  This hook is a good place to perform state
- *	changes on the process such as clearing out non-inheritable signal
- *	state.  This is called immediately after commit_creds().

  * Security hooks for mount using fs_context.
