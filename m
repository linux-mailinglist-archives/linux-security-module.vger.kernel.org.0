I don't think you need to hunt them down. It should be fine to add PCI
IDs to the driver without reference document. Of course I'm not the
maintainer of this driver but I suspect nobody cares.

If it depends on that functionality then you may simply add something
like this in lpc_ich.c:

#if IS_ENABLED(CONFIG_SECURITY)
static int lpc_ich_init_securityfs(struct pci_dev *dev)
{
	...
}
#else
static inline int lpc_ich_init_securityfs(struct pci_dev *dev) { return 0; }
#endif

I mean empty stubs when the feature is not enabled so the callers can
always call them. This avoids most ugly #ifdefs.

Yes, so for these recent CPUs the SPI-NOR is actually a PCI device
itself so it is not exposed through LPC/eSPI. In many cases the device
is disabled by the BIOS so you can't see it if you run lspci. For
example my SPT based laptop the device is not visible.

For the security stuff you are adding, do you need to look at the PCI
device registers as well? Then some of these bits (at least WPD) is part
of the config space of that device. In that case lpc_ich may not be the
right place for this after all.

No problem :)

Typically inline is good. I suggest you to run

  $ scripts/get_maintainers.pl path/to/the/patch

and see who actually maintains this thing. Then, based on the above, if
you still add it this driver you can send the patch again (I suggest to
use git send-email) and Cc the maintainer(s). Actually there is this
entry in MAINTAINERS:

ICH LPC AND GPIO DRIVER
M:      Peter Tyser <ptyser@xes-inc.com>
S:      Maintained
F:      drivers/gpio/gpio-ich.c
F:      drivers/mfd/lpc_ich.c

So you should Cc Peter as well. And also the MFD maintainer (Lee Jones)
but get_maintainers.pl should list him.
