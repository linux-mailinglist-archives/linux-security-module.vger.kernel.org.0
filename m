IIUC, James re-work for TPM trusted keys is to allow loading of sealed
trusted keys directly via user-space (with proper authorization) into
the kernel keyring.

I think similar should be achievable with OP-TEE (via extending pseudo
TA [1]) as well to allow restricted user-space access (with proper
authorization) to generate sealed trusted key blob that should be
interoperable with the kernel. Currently OP-TEE exposes trusted key
interfaces for kernel users only.
