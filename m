I think this needs to be discussed if and when we allow LKM based LSMs.

One needs to know MAX_LSM_COUNT at compile time (not via kernel
command line), I really suggest you try out your suggestions before
posting them. I had explained this to you earlier, you still chose to
ignore and keep suggesting stuff that does not work.

https://lore.kernel.org/bpf/CACYkzJ7Dn=3DW1Kd5M_bXOzoomzdjMXBoEZZo5k=3DcgQ4=
R6f5G+vw@mail.gmail.com/

It is used in the preprocessor to generate the static calls, it cannot
come from the command line.

We will see when this happens. I don't think it's a difficult problem
and there are many ways to implement this:

* Add a new slot(s) for modular LSMs (One can add up to N fast modular LSMs=
)
* Fallback to a linked list for modular LSMs, that's not a complexity.
There are serious performance gains and I think it's a fair trade-off.
This isn't even complex.

Now, this patch and the patch that makes security_hook_heads
__ro_after_init by removing CONFIG_SECURITY_HOOKS_WRITABLE breaks your
hack. But that hack (https://akari.osdn.jp/1.0/chapter-3.html.en) is
unsupported.

No, that's not complicated.  All I can say is, when the time comes,
and if the community agrees on LMK based modules, this patch won't
make it any difficult or easy. There are many implementations, even
this patch, that can provide LKM based LSMs API (but hacks will be
hard, sure!)
