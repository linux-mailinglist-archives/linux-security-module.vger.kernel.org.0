Are you honestly uncertain after our discussions today?  I'll be
honest and say that I'm a little confused as I thought I made it very
clear when I told you to just be patient off-list, and reminded you in
this thread that the patchset was in my review queue and I will get to
it once it bubbles to the top.  I don't know what else to say here ...
?

As far as the CONFIG_SECURITY_HOOK_LIKELY patch, looking back at my
comments from September [1] there is a clear statement that I am not
in favor of this patch along with a brief explanation as to why:

 "I'm not in favor of adding a Kconfig option for something
  like this.  If you have an extremely well defined use case
  then you can probably do the work to figure out the
  "correct" value for the tunable, but for a general purpose
  kernel build that will have different LSMs active, a
  variety of different BPF LSM hook implementations at
  different times, etc. there is little hope to getting this
  right."

... and that was back when the knob actually did something, as you
pointed out in this thread, the v8 version of this patch doesn't
appear to do anything, which is really baffling and not a good sign.
As far as what to do about this patch, in our off-list discussion I
asked you and KP to refrain from respinning the patchset just to get
rid of this patch, but keep it in mind for future submissions.

Hopefully by repeating the important bits of the conversation you now
understand that there is nothing you can do at this moment to speed my
review of this patchset, but there are things you, and KP, can do in
the future if additional respins are needed.  However, if you are
still confused, it may be best to go do something else for a bit and
then revisit this email because there is nothing more that I can say
on this topic at this point in time.
