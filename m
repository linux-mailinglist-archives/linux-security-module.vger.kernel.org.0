Yes, I have a patch for this but was told it would be better to send
the patch through my tree rather than the security tree. I can send a
pull request for that.

Got it.

This was not in linux-next, but was tested by Jann on a Chrome OS
device. There's also the selftest for this code. But I can send
non-trivial stuff to linux-next first next time.

Got it.

Makes sense. The development was not actually done on that kernel, I
just grabbed that random kernel for committing the changes on top of
(these changes were developed a little while ago, but they're all self
contained to the SafeSetID LSM), but I'll pick a stable one next time.

Thanks for the pointer. I had not seen that yet.

Yep, makes sense.

Thanks!
