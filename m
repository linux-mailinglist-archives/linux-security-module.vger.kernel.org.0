I'm not going to disagree with that, I generally require matching
tests for new SELinux kernel code, but I was careful to mention code
under 'security/' and not necessarily just a test implementation :)  I
don't want to get into a big discussion about it, but I think having a
working implementation somewhere under 'security/' is more
discoverable for most LSM folks.
