Why not do the key management in userspace, like tpm-tools
(https://github.com/tpm2-software/tpm2-tools)?  There are a lot of uses for this
type of hardware besides in-kernel crypto.  See
https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Trusted_Platform_Module for all the things you
can do with the TPM on Linux, including LUKS encryption; this is all with
userspace key management.  Wouldn't the CAAM hardware be useful for similar
purposes and thus need a similar design as well, e.g. with functionality exposed
through some /dev node for userspace to use?  Or are you saying it will only
ever be useful for in-kernel crypto?

It does *not* fix it, as your patch only provides an option to use the kernel's
RNG whereas the default is still the TPM's RNG.

Most people don't change defaults.

Essentially your same argument was used for Dual_EC_DRBG; people argued it was
okay to standardize because people had the option to choose their own constants
if they felt the default constants were backdoored.  That didn't really matter,
though, since in practice everyone just used the default constants.

Elsewhere you are claiming that "trusted" keys can never be disclosed to
userspace.  So you can't rely on userspace cooperating, right?
