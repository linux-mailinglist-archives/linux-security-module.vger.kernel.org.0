This is not "novel", it's a fairly common pattern followed in tracing:

For example, the TRACE_INCLUDE macro which is used for tracepoints:

  include/trace/define_trace.h

and used in:

  * include/trace/bpf_probe.h

    https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/master/include/trace/bpf_probe.h#L110

  * include/trace/perf.h

    https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/master/include/trace/perf.h#L90

  * include/trace/trace_events.h

    https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/master/include/trace/trace_events.h#L402

I don't fully understand what "two sets diverge means" here. All the
BPF headers need is the name, return type and the args. This is the
same information which is needed by the call_{int, void}_hooks and the
LSM declarataions (i.e. security_hook_heads and
security_list_options).

As I have previously said, we will be happy to (and have already)
updated our approach based on the consensus we arrive at here. The
best outcome would be to not sacrifice performance as the LSM hooks
are called from various performance critical code-paths.

It would be great to know the maintainers' (BPF and Security)
perspective on this as well.
