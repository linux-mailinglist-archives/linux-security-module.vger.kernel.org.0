Yes. It's under /sys/kernel/security/tpm0/  All the ima policy control
and its log is under /sys/kernel/security/ima/  that's why I think
declaring securityfs as being for anything security related is already
our de facto (if not de jure) policy.

I know Al likes this business of loads of separate filesystems, but
personally I'm not in favour.  For every one you do, you not only have
to document it all, you also have to find a preferred mount point that
the distributions can agree on and also have them agree to enable the
mount for, which often takes months of negotiation.  Having fewer
filesystems grouped by common purpose which have agreed mount points
that distros actually mount seems a far easier approach to enablement.
