Hi Simon,

Thanks for you help, i may got it, here is the new commit message:


The current IMA ruleset is identified by the variable "ima_rules"
that default to "&ima_default_rules". When loading a custom policy
for the first time, the variable is updated to "&ima_policy_rules"
instead. That update isn't RCU-safe, and deadlocks are possible.
Because some functions like ima_match_policy() may loop indefinitely
over traversing the "ima_default_rules" as list_for_each_entry_rcu().

When iterating over the default ruleset back to head, value of
"&entry->list" is "&ima_default_rules", and "ima_rules" may have been
updated to "&ima_policy_rules", the loop condition (&entry->list != ima_rules)
stay alway true, traversing doesn't terminate, cause soft lockup and
RCU stalls.

Introduce a temporary value for "ima_rules" when iterating over
the ruleset to avoid the deadlocks.
