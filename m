Yeah, this probably should use the same check as the CLONE_NEWUSER
logic, current_chrooted() from CLONE_NEWUSER; that check is already
used for guarding against the following syscall sequence, which has
similar security properties:
unshare(CLONE_NEWUSER); // gives the current process namespaced CAP_SYS_ADM=
IN
chroot("<...>"); // succeeds because of namespaced CAP_SYS_ADMIN

The current_chrooted() check in create_user_ns() is for the same
purpose as the check you're introducing here, so they should use the
same logic.
