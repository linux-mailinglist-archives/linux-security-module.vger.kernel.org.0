Ok, this makes sense to me.  I will send the patch's next version as-is
anyway for completeness since it's basically done but I recognize that we
might change the plan based on this discussion.

Right.  In that case, would it make sense to pass sk into the new
security_unix_find() hook, perhaps with the new argument named `struct
sock *other`?  Then we can use this hook for the scope check as well by
using landlock_cred(other->sk_socket->file->f_cred)->domain etc.

By doing this we won't even need to pass `type` separately anymore.  The
only change would be that now one can determine if a socket is bound or
not even without being allowed RESOLVE_UNIX access.  I'm not sure how much
of an issue this is, but we could also call the hook anyway with a NULL in
place of the new argument, if unix_find_socket_byinode() fails.  Other
LSMs can then decide what to do in that case (either return -ECONNREFUSED
or -EPERM).

I think the logic would basically be:

1. if any layers deny the access due to handled RESOLVE_UNIX but does not
have the scope bit set, then we will deny rightaway, without calling
domain_is_scoped().

2. Call domain_is_scoped() with a bitmask of "rules_covered" layers where
there are RESOLVE_UNIX rules covering the socket being accessed, and
essentially ignore those layers in the scope violation check.

I definitely agree that it is tricky, but making same-scope access be
allowed (i.e. the suggested idea above) would only get rid of step 1,
which I think is the "simpler" bit.  The extra logic in step 2 is still
needed. 

I definitely agree with pro1 tho.

This exact API would no longer work, but if we give up the equivalence
between scope bits and the landlock_scope_attr struct, then we can do
something like:

struct landlock_scope_attr {
    __u64 ptrace:1;  /* Note that this is not a (user controllable) scope bit! */
    __u64 abstract_unix_socket:1;
    __u64 pathname_unix_socket:1;
    /* ... */

    __u64 allowed_signals;

    /*
     * some way to identify domains, maybe we could use the audit domain
     * ID, with 0 denoting "allow access to non-Landlocked processes?
     */
}

I will think about the following a bit more but I'm afraid that I feel
like it might get slightly confusing.  With this, the only reason for
having LANDLOCK_SCOPE_PATHNAME_UNIX_SOCKET is for API consistency when we
later enable allowing access to other domains (if I understood correctly),
in which case I personally feel like the suggestion on landlock_scope_attr
above, where we essentially accept that it is decoupled with the scope
bits in the ruleset, might be simpler...?
