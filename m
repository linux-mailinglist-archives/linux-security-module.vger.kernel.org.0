(Side remark on the idea of storing "pending domain updates" in the task bl=
ob:

I have pondered such an idea as well, where we do not store the Landlock do=
main
itself in the task blob, but only a "pending" update that we need to do to =
the
Landlock domain in creds, and then to apply that opportunistically/lazily a=
s
part of other Landlock LSM calls.

I believe in this approach, it becomes hard to control whether that update =
can
actually ever get applied.  So to be sure, we would always have to run unde=
r the
assumption that it does not get applied, and then we might as well store th=
e
Landlock domain directly in the task blob.

I also don't think this makes sense.)

It doesn't?

In my mind, the main goal of the patch set is that we can enable Landlock i=
n
multithreaded processes like in Go programs or in multithreaded C(++).

With Approach 4, we would admittedly still have to do some work in userspac=
e,
and it would not have the nice all-or-nothing semantics, but at least, it w=
ould
be possible to get all threads joining the same Landlock domain.  (And afte=
r
all, setuid(0) also does not have the all-or-nothing semantics, from what I=
 can
tell.)

Fair enough, a different FD type for that would also be possible.

+1, agreed.  That would let us skip the check for the pre-existing domain o=
n
these threads.

You mean for Landlock's selftests?  I thought these were running in their o=
wn
forked-off subprocess?  I'm probably misunderstanding you here. :)

I don't see an option how we could freeze the credentials of other threads:

To freeze a task's credentials, we would have to inhibit that commit_creds(=
)
succeeds on that task, and I don't see how that would be done - we can not
prevent these tasks from calling commit_creds() [1], and when commit_creds(=
)
gets called, it is guaranteed to work.

So in my mind, we have to somehow deal with the possibility that a task has=
 a
new and not-previously-seen struct creds, by the time that its task_work ge=
ts
called.  As a consequence, I think a call to prepare_creds() would then be
unavoidable in the task_work?
