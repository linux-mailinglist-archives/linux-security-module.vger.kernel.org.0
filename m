Is it that impending? At least for now it seems people are more
concerned about quantum-safe TLS, so their communications cannot be
decrypted later. But breaking signatures of open source modules
probably only makes sense when there is an actual capability to break
RSA (or ECDSA)

Does it matter from a kernel perspective? As far as I remember we just
attach the "plain" signature to binary. Or is it about provisioning
the key through the keystore?

Can indeed work for modules, but with our limited deployment of IMA in
production with many services even with the current approach we get
some complains:
  * verification takes too long for some binaries (which were not
stripped for example)
  * just hashing the binaries over and over burns some CPU and
actually burns only 1 CPU at a time (stalling it)

We need to consider cases, for example, when a python script calls
some binaries via system(3) or similar in a tight loop. Yes, with IMA
we would verify only once, but still there are cases, when software
updates happen frequently or config management "templates" the
binaries, so they change all the time.

Agreed - we should have an in-kernel option

Yep, mentioned above.

This makes it somewhat similar to UEFI secure boot trusted signature
DB, where one can have either a trusted public key to verify the
signature or a direct allowlist of hashes
