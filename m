I feel it might be a good idea to explain why and how this constant
must be used. In my understanding, ACCESS_INITIALLY_DENIED must be
bitwise-or'd to ruleset->fs_access_masks[...] everytime that it is
being read? (That is at least the case everywhere in fs.c.)

(I still suspect that the layering might be easier to understand if we
already populated fs_access_masks with the 'refer' flag set, but I'm
not feeling that strongly about it if you want to keep it as is.)

(Putting this in parenthesis, because it's maybe out of scope for this
code review:

It seems to me that the two nested loops in get_handled_accesses() are
equivalent to doing:

   access_mask_t access_dom = ACCESS_INITIALLY_DENIED;
   size_t i;
   for (i = 0; i < domain->num_layers; i++) {
       access_dom |= domain->fs_access_masks[i];
   }
   return access_dom;

I have my doubts that the early break in the inner loop makes any
difference performance wise when we can replace one of the loops with
bitwise operations?

Even more unrelated thoughts:

In a similar fashion, a lot of the fs.c bit logic could be simplified
by inverting the layer_masks to be a max-layers-sized array of access
masks instead of a max-access-right-sized array of layer masks. I
notice that you have been counting the individual bytes for this
structure in the "refer" patch set though :-/ I wish this was
simpler...

I imagine that walking the path once per layer to unmask the
access_req for each layer was also discussed at the time, but then
discarded? (Is this to protect against concurrent modifications to the
file hierarchy?)

(These remarks are definitely out of scope for this change, they just
came up because I tried to understand all the surrounding code. I
guess I'm still catching up...))

If I understand correctly, this was the place where the logic bug was
- is that correct?

* with one ruleset where handled_access_fs *does not* have refer,
  it returns EXDEV (OK)
* with one ruleset where handled_access_fs *does* have refer,
  it continues (OK)
* with two ruleset where one does and the other does not have refer,
  it acts like refer is handled and continues without EXDEV
  but it should have returned EXDEV because that was the strict behaviour of
  the "v1"-style ruleset.

I think it's better to handle the V1 and V2 calls in a more unified
way, good to remove this backwards compatibility check.

Do I understand correctly that these changes are the cases where we
were previously hitting the early -EXDEV return (the one which I
commented on above)? So now a V1-style Landlock ruleset (without refer
in handled_access_fs) will result in errors that are in line with what
would happen if the refer right had been part of handled_access_fs in
the same ruleset?

This is a slight API change, but only in error codes and hopefully
within reason. I hope the backwards compatibility policy is a bit
forgiving in such cases? (Landlock does not have that many users yet,
after all.)

These are just test style comments, so non-blockers in my mind; I find
the interface to the refer_denied_by_default helper function difficult
and it required a bit of jumping back and forth to make sense of it. I
find it often useful to use an approach where each test helper only
spans one of the test phases (set up / exercise / assert) - that helps
to keep the overall test structure in that set up / exercise / assert
form.

I imaginge that these tests could in principle look roughly like this:

TEST_F_FORK(layout1, refer_denied_by_default1)
{
	ASSERT_EQ(0, landlock_restrict_fs(LANDLOCK_ACCESS_FS_REFER, (struct rule[]){
        	{
                	.path = "superdir";
                        .access = LANDLOCK_ACCESS_FS_REFER,
                },
                {},
        }));
        EXPECT_EQ(0, test_rename("superdir/file1", "superdir/subdir/file1"));

	ASSERT_EQ(0, landlock_restrict_fs(LANDLOCK_ACCESS_FS_EXECUTE, (struct rule[]){
        	{
                	.path = "superdir";
                        .access = LANDLOCK_ACCESS_FS_EXECUTE,
                },
                {},
        }));
        EXPECT_EQ(EXDEV, test_rename("superdir/file2", "superdir/subdir/file2"));
}

Small optional remark on the side: I find the test scenario has a
slightly better punchline when turning around the order in which the
two layers are installed - because that also worked prior to this fix,
and it's more clearly wrong, as it was possible to do *more*
operations after installing the second layer.
