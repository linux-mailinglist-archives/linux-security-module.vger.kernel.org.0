The latest iteration can be found here:

https://lore.kernel.org/linux-integrity/20241119104922.2772571-1-roberto.sa=
ssu@huaweicloud.com/

It is more or less ready for upstreaming (from my point of view), with
the exception of a few comments that I still need to address.

The main problem was parsing the RPM headers in the kernel, that Linus
didn't like, but I believe I solved it now with Mimi's suggestion of
making the digest list parsers pluggable (so the RPM parser has been
removed from this submission, and moved to a kernel module that is
expected to be signed by distros).

I explored the alternative of moving the parser to user space, but as
you mentioned, it is a more risky approach.

Other than that, yes, it makes IMA much faster in my benchmarks (~34
seconds to lookup 12312 digests and verify 303 ECDSA signatures, as
opposed to ~98 seconds to verify 12312 ECDSA signatures).
