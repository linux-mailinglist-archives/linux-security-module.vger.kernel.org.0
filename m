The idea is probably along the same lines as yours: let user space
define/categorize ioctls.  For example, for a camera driver, users can
define two planes - control plane: setup parameters of lens, data
plane: setup data buffers for data transfer and do start/stop (I'm
just making up the example since I don't really know the camera
driver).

The idea is for Landlock to provide a mechanism to let user space to
divide/assign ioctls to different planes, such that the user space
processes can set/define security boundaries according to the plane it
is on.

ya,  it will help with the design if there is a real world scenario to stud=

Yes. That makes sense.
