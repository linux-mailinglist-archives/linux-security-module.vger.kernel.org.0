The only other commit that seems relevant was this one:

https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/libs/libcap/libcap.git/commit/libcap/cap_text.c?id=afb17b8c007a49d93b0d30936b2d65af1bfdb039

But I think this was all part of the same effort.

I recall spending a day or more trying to avoid it, but I can't see
how it is really fixable because there are too many moving parts.

If the kernel adds another capability, then =ep could reasonably mean
both the "old full set" or the "new full set". There are contexts
where the difference matters. For example, where folk are using text
representations for things like package manager shell-script setups.
What they get when they say "=ep
cap_setpcap,cap_sys_admin,cap_setfcap-ep" today, might suddenly be
inappropriate when the new kernel adds "cap_self_destruct". At least
the way it is at present, we are very explicit about what is in
effect.

Cheers
