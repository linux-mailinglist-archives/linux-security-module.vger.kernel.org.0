One of the more important requirements for any new LSM is that it
documents a clear, understandable, and reasonable security model along
with an implementation that faithfully implements that model.  Before
I looked at your code I wanted to try and understand the TSEM security
model and a few things jumped out at me rather quickly, I imagine
there would be others as I start to look a bit closer but I wanted to
send these questions/comments along now to get your take on them ...

I'm guessing the above is a typo and you mean PCRs 0 through 7 (not
8)?  If not, you need to provide an explanation somewhere as to what
you are using PCR 8 for in TSEM and how it is extended, etc.

Given the very volatile nature of this value, what is it used for in
userspace?  My apologies if I missed it in the docs.

A similar questions to the tsem/measurement file.  If I understand you
correctly, this is basically a series of SHA256 digests without any
additional annotations, and without any ordering guarantees, yes?
What is it used for in userspace?

It might be nice to explain how this value is calculated here in this
file to remove any time or ordering dependencies.  Once again my
apologies if I missed it in the rest of the docs.

I think it would be good to provide a concrete definition of
CELL_DEFINITION field as other areas of the documentation make
reference to it within the tsem/trajectory file documentation.  We can
somewhat infer it's format, fields, etc. but it's much better to be
explicit about these things.

I'm unclear as to the purpose of the event{} field as it is neither
part of the COE or the CELL, is it here simply to make the event
easier to read?  Or am I misunderstanding things and the event{} field
is part of the COE?

What happens in cases where multiple file paths are present in an
event?  Also, given this is visible to userspace, and multiple things
can affect the path to a file (e.g. namespaces), how is the file path
determined?

Given the ability to map UID/GID values in the kernel, what will be
used as the basis for the COE?  What happens when the basis used in
the kernel's COE generation does not match the basis used by the
external modeler?

Similar to the task UID/GID mapping questions above, there are
mechanisms which map the file user/group IDs, which will be used in
the CELL definition and how will that be resolved between the kernel
and an external modeler?

I worry whenever I see a PID used as an identifier shared across the
kernel/userspace boundary as it is inherently racy.  Given the
somewhat coarse COE definition where one can expect multiple
processes/PIDs to share the same COE value, and the ability of
untrusted users/processes to manipulate the PID table, what do you
expect to use the pid{NNN} field for in this event?

Similar to the other namespace/mapping issues discussed previously,
there is also the PID namespace issue to worry about.  How is that
handled here?

The 'trusted PID:' and 'untrusted PID:' commands are concerning for
the reasons described above about PIDs being racy and generally an
unreliable way of identifying processes across the kernel/userspace
boundary.  I suspect it would not be too difficult for a malicious
user to trick an external modeler into marking the wrong process as
trusted/untrusted.

This seems like an unusual design choice, and perhaps one born from
necessity ... ?  It's nice that it is opt-in, but I would be curious
to hear what problems this solved.

It seems like making the target PCR configurable would be a good idea,
at the very least make it a Kconfig option.

Also, can you elaborate on how the security state points are extended
into the PCR?  I imagine for it to be useful at an arbitrary point in
time this would require the PCR to be extended as the security points
were generated, which would imply that the PCR value would be
dependent on execution order, and in most cases, scheduling order as
well.  How useful do you expect this to be for most users?

This is a pretty big limitation, and in conjunction with the some of
the other issues brought up earlier (the PID issue seems the most
concerning), I'm having a difficult time believeing that an external
modeler could operate safely given the design presented here.

Unfortunately, there will always be LSM hooks which need to operate in
a non-blocking context, meaning this challenge is here to stay.  Help
me understand how you could safely do asynchronous policy enforcement
with an external modeler, I'm not sure it's possible.

Frankly, I also wonder how a system would perform with an external
modeler, indepdent of the issues with non-blocking hooks.  How does
the system perform with every blockable LSM hook invocation
potentially blocking on a response from userspace?  Or with the COE
being somewhat coarse, does the trajectory/policy populate itself
quickly?

It appears that all of the hasing in TSEM is SHA256 based, you might
want to consider making that a Kconfig option at the very least.
