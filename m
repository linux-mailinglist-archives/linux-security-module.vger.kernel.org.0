But we are talking of the case here where SecureBoot is *off*,
i.e. there is a concious decision in place that there is no trust
chain, and that the firmware *happily* *already* accepts unsigned boot
loaders/kernels and just runs with them. If SecureBoot is already off,
then an attacker can patch around in the kernel invoked at boot
completely freely anyway, there is *no* authentication done. Hence
it's really weird to then insist that the path into the kernel keyring
via mok keys is off in *only* this case, because an attacker can get
into that anyway in this case, it's just a lot more cumbersome.

It's really strange that currently when people ask for tight security
(i.e. SB on) the linux kernel is super relaxed and allows any keys to
be inserted, but if people ask for security checks to be off (i.e. SB
off) the kernel starts being super strict and doesn't allow any keys
to propagate into mok. That's really confusing and contradictory, no?
