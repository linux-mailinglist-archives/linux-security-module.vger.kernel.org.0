I have no arguments against any of the above, and would prefer to see
something like this over a token-based mechanism.  However we do want
to make sure we have the proper LSM control points for either approach
so that admins who rely on LSM-based security policies can manage
delegation via their policies.

Using the fsconfig() approach described by Christian above, I believe
we should have the necessary hooks already in
security_fs_context_parse_param() and security_sb_mnt_opts() but I'm
basing that on a quick look this morning, some additional checking
would need to be done.
