Before expanding the set of keys permitted to blacklist a key on the
IMA keyring, there needs to be a way of differentiating how keys may
be used.  The same certificate should not be allowed to be loaded onto
both the IMA and the IMA blacklist keyrings for obvious reasons.

The normal way of blacklisting a key is by using CRLs.  I'm not
recommending adding full CRL support in the kernel, but using the key
usage extension to differentiate who may sign a certificate being
black listed.  Please refer to section "4.2.1.3.  Key Usage", in
particular the cRLSign bit.

thanks,

Mimi
