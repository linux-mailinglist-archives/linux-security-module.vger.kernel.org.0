Indeed, this is currently only documented in code. zboot is a PE
executable that decompresses the kernel and boots it, but it also
carries the base and size of the compressed payload in its header,
along with the compression type so non-EFI loaders can run it as well
(QEMU implements this for gzip on arm64)

Absolutely. RFCs are important because nobody knows how exactly the
code will look until someone takes the time to implement it. So your
work on this is much appreciated, even if we may decide to take
another approach down the road.

Yes, it looks appealing but it will take some time to iterate on ideas
and converge on an implementation.

Yes, this should be possible.

Not sure whether this matters. The TPM logic is exposed via EFI
protocols, and the kernel could either expose them or not. If it does,
and we execute the EFI stub (sytemd-stub) code all the way through to
ExitBootServices() while executing in the old kernel, we could even
take PCR measurements and display them, giving us secure and measured
boot for kexec.

I don't think EDK2 is suitable for this - the code style is different,
the license is different and it is simply a lot of code.

What I would prefer is to define a subset of the EFI boot services
that we actually rely on, and perhaps even introduce some other
constraints on the EFI code, e.g., allow it to run unprivileged.

That way, kexec could execute the EFI stub as an ordinary user process
(to some extent), including allocations for the decompressed kernel,
initrd, etc. Finally, the only thing purgatory would need to do is
linearize the populated regions in the VA space and copy them to
physical memory.

This all sounds very high-level, and there may be some difficulties
down the road, but I think this deserves a proper look because it is
an appealing way to make EFI execution idempotent in the context of
kexec, and also reduces the arch-specific logic substantially.
