Thanks, I was worried that there was also something more tricky than
this. We could make adding-removing the kernel parameter easier on
Fedora by creating and maintaining a tool that would be able to do it
reliably across the supported arches. That shouldn't be too hard,
hopefully.

OK, so I'll put together another patch that removes all the
security_delete_hooks() stuff and adds the checks.

Yes, that sounds reasonable.
