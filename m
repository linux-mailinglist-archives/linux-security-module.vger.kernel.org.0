This 1B variant is not OK because it would remove the guarantee that the
whole process is restricted.

Indeed, commit_creds() should always return 0.  My full proposal does
not look safe enough, but the cred_transfer() helper can still be
useful.

Fair. ERESTARTNOINTR should only be used by a syscall implementation.

struct cred is used to check if a task subject can access a task object.
Landlock's metadata must stay in struct cred to be available when
checking access to any kernel object.  The LSM hooks reflect this
rationale by only passing struct cred when checking a task (e.g.
security_task_kill()'s cred).

seccomp only cares about filtering raw syscalls, and the seccomp filters
are just ignored when the kernel (with an LSM or not) checks task's
permission to access another task.

The per-task security blob could store some state though, e.g. to
identify if a domain needs to be updated, but I don't see a use case
here.

Right. This approach is interesting, but it does not solve the main
issue here.

Anyway, being able to enter a Landlock domain would definitely be
useful. I would prefer using a pidfd to refer to a task's Landlock
domain, which would avoid race condition and make the API clearer.  It
would be nice to be able to pass a pidfd (instead of a ruleset) to
landlock_restrict_self().  If we want to directly deal with a domain, we
should create a dedicated domain FD type.

Thinking more about this feature, it might actually make sense to
synchronize all threads from the same process without checking other
threads' Landlock domain. The rationale are:
1. Linux threads are not security boundaries and it is allowed for a
   thread to control other threads' memory, which means changing their
   code flow.  In other words, thread's permissions are the union of all
   thread's permissions in the same process.
2. libpsx and libc's set*id() ignore other thread's credentials and just
   blindly execute the same code on all threads.
3. It would be simpler and would avoid another error case.

An issue could happen if a Landlock domain restricting a test thread is
replaced.  I don't think the benefit of avoiding this issue is worth it
compared to the guarantee we get when forcing the sandboxing of a full
process without error.

We should rename the flag to LANDLOCK_RESTRICT_SELF_PROCESS to make it
clear what it does.

The remaining issues are still the potential memory allocation failures.
There are two things:

1. We should try as much as possible to limit useless credential
   duplications by not creating a new struct cred if parent credentials
   are the same.

2. To avoid the libpsx inconsistency (because of ENOMEM or EPERM),
   landlock_restrict_self(2) should handle memory allocation and
   transition the process from a known state to another known state.

What about this approach:
- "Freeze" all threads of the current process (not ideal but simple) to
  make sure their credentials don't get updated.
- Create a new blank credential for the calling thread.
- Walk through all threads and create a new blank credential for all
  threads with a different cred than the caller.
- Inject a task work that will call cred_transfer() for all threads with
  either the same new credential used by the caller (incrementing the
  refcount), or it will populate and use a blank one if it has different
  credentials than the caller.

This may not efficiently deduplicate credentials for all threads but it
is a simple deduplication approach that should be useful in most cases.

The difficult part is mainly in the "fleezing". It would be nice to
change the cred API to avoid that but I'm not sure how.
