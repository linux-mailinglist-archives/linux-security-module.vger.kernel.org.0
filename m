While I don't doubt that some would view the choices made in
describing TSEM as necessary, it is important to remember that those
judgements, as well as my own, are subjective.  I appreciate the time
and effort that has gone into the TSEM documentation (and welcome the
care behind it!), but I very much agree with the sentiments in the
video snippet Serge linked.
