In cryptography, integrity normally means knowing whether data has been
non-maliciously changed, while authenticity means knowing whether data is from a
particular source, which implies knowing whether it has been changed at all
(whether maliciously or not).  Consider that there are "Message Authentication
Codes" (MACs) and "Authenticated Encryption", not "Message Integrity Codes" and
"Intact Encryption".

Unfortunately lots of people do overload "integrity" to mean authenticity, so
you're not alone.  But it's confusing, so if you're going to do that then please
make sure to clearly explain what you mean.

IMA doesn't require logging or "measuring" hashes, though.  Those are just some
of its supported features.  And I thought the IMA developers were planning to
add support for fs-verity hashes, and that it wouldn't require an entirely new
architecture to do so.

Anyway, while it does sound to me like you're duplicating IMA, I don't really
have a horse in this race, and I defer to the IMA developers on this.  I trust
that you've been engaging with them?  This patchset isn't even Cc'ed to
linux-integrity, so it's unclear that's been happening.
