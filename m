The "to to" takes a couple of reads to parse.  Would "...this limits the 
set of abstract :manpage:`unix(7)` sockets to which we can 
:manpage:`connect(2)` to socket addresses which were..." perhaps be 
easier to read?

Maybe overly pedantic, but I wonder if something like "will not be 
restricted" instead of "will work" would be clearer?  "Work" just has a 
lot of meanings.  I don't think it's actually ambiguous as written, I 
just think that a more precise word could avoid the potential for confusion.
