Paul, the design copies the measurement list to a temporary "snapshot"
file, before trimming the measurement list, which according to the
design document locks the existing measurement list.  And further
pauses extending the measurement list to calculate the
"snapshot_aggregate".

Userspace can export the measurement list already, so why this
complicated design?

As I mentioned previously and repeated yesterday, the
"snapshot_aggregate" is a new type of critical data and should be
upstreamed independently of this patch set that trims the measurement
list.  Trimming the measurement list could be based, as you suggested
on the number of records to remove, or it could be up to the next/last
"snapshot_aggregate" record.
