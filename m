Starting with LANDLOCK_ACCESS_FS_TRUNCATE, it is worth explaining why we
choose to restrict access checks at open time.  This new "File
descriptor access rights" section is complementary to the existing
"Inode access rights" section.  Add a new guiding principle related to
this section.

 ``LANDLOCK_ACCESS_FS_REMOVE_FILE`` or ``LANDLOCK_ACCESS_FS_REFER`` are not

+File descriptor access rights
+-----------------------------
+
+Access rights are checked and tied to file descriptors at open time.  The
+underlying principle is that equivalent sequences of operations should lead to
+the same results, when they are executed under the same Landlock domain.
+
+Taking the ``LANDLOCK_ACCESS_FS_TRUNCATE`` right as an example, it may be
+allowed to open a file for writing without being allowed to
+:manpage:`ftruncate` the resulting file descriptor if the related file
+hierarchy doesn't grant such access right.  The following sequences of
+operations have the same semantic and should then have the same result:
+
+* ``truncate(path);``
+* ``int fd = open(path, O_WRONLY); ftruncate(fd); close(fd);``
+
+Similarly to file access modes (e.g. ``O_RDWR``), Landlock access rights
+attached to file descriptors are retained even if they are passed between
+processes (e.g. through a Unix domain socket).  Such access rights will then be
+enforced even if the receiving process is not sandboxed by Landlock.  Indeed,
+this is required to keep a consistent access control over the whole system, and
+avoid unattended bypasses through file descriptor passing (i.e. confused deputy
+attack).
