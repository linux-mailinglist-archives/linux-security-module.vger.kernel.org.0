I mentioned TOMOYO as an example of how to implement a supervisor feature, for
there is a pitfall when involving userspace. What is important for implementing
a supervisor feature is how to avoid deadlocks, for userspace might unexpectedly
pause due to page fault events. If the supervisor process is blocked due to a
page fault event, the process which is requesting some access is also blocked.

Thank you. TOMOYO's tools is implemented as CUI-only for minimizing dependency.
I wasn't aware of [2].

Since TOMOYO does not use audit subsystem, the format of query is essentially
the format of access logs. Just invoking immediately before rejecting an access
request. Quite simple approach. ;-)

There is no git tree. Only subversion repository
( https://sourceforge.net/p/tomoyo/svn/HEAD/tree/ ) is available.

Welcomed.

For landlock, I guess you assume that the supervisor process is not blocked
(because landlock is intended for subset of userspace processes), but what if
the supervisor process tries something that will be blocked by landlock
(e.g. spawning a userspace program in landlock-controlled environment) ?
Is there a guarantee that the supervisor process can never request something
that will be blocked by landlock itself (or other security modules that are
active) ?

Use of GUI tends to introduce multi-threaded or multi-processed program or
invoke unexpected system call that will block the supervisor process itself.
I consider that TOMOYO can't provide proof of deadlock-free in GUI. Therefore,
tomoyo-queryd runs as a single-threaded-single-processed program.

I hope that my experience helps your implementation.
