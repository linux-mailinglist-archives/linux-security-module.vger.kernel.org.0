The root of trust for the new "machine" keyring, at least in the UEFI
use case, is registering keys in the MOK db, which requires physical
presence.  So we're trusting the MOK db, which means we're really
trusting both the admin and UEFI to do the right things.  There is no
harm in verifying the CA assumption when loading the certs onto the
"machine" keyring.

From an IMA perspective, all that is needed to sign an IMA custom
policy and local code is the ability to load a single self-signed CA
certificate.  So the self-signed CA restriction is fine.  Obviously
other use cases are being discussed here.  If the other use cases want
to relax the self-signed CA restriction to allow intermediary CA's, it
should be explicitly called out in a separate patch, with its own patch
description, providing the motivation.

thanks,

Mimi
