My mistake.  I know how hard naming can be, so if you feel like "CELL"
is the best choice here I'm not going to object, however, I think it
is worth a mention that in our acronym heavy industry any term that is
presented in all caps is often seen as an acronym and not a metaphor.

My recommendation is to simply avoid any mention of other LSMs.  Not
only does it avoid any unforeseen negative comparisons, it also
encourages the documentation to fully explain the LSM without having
to rely on an understanding of another, which could result in its own
set of problems.

Ignoring any technical issues for a moment, I would strongly suggest
against that approach for the reasons given above.  I can appreciate
that your intent is likely to demonstrate the capabilities of TSEM,
but doing so by emulating an existing LSM sets a bad precedent and I
will not view it positively.

I believe the LSM can support both the enforcement of security policy
and the observation of security relevant events on a system.  In fact
most of the existing LSMs do both, at least to some extent.

However, while logging of security events likely needs to be
asynchronous for performance reasons, enforcement of security policy
likely needs to be synchronous to have any reasonable level of
assurance.  You are welcome to propose LSMs which provide
observability functionality that is either sync, async, or some
combination of both (? it would need to make sense to do both ?), but
I'm not currently interested in accepting LSMs that provide
asynchronous enforcement as I don't view that as a "reasonable"
enforcement mechanism.

This still seems somewhat suspicious as there are a couple of GFP
flags that allow for non-blocking allocations in all but a few cases,
but I'll defer further discussion of that until I get to the code.  In
my opinion, there are still enough red flags in these documentation
reviews to keep me from investing the time in reviewing the TSEM code.

Regardless, I stand by my previous comment that discussion of these
caches may be a bit more detail that is needed in this document, but
of course that is your choice.  It's a balancing act between providing
enough high level detail to satisfy users and reviewers, and producing
a document that is so verbose that the time required to properly
review it is prohibitive.

Yet a PID is still exported to an external orchestrator.

Look around, it is happening now.  Of course the level of risk varies
tremendously based on the application and yes, the chosen hash
function.  However, given the composition of TSEM's CELL value in some
events, and the importance of a hashed event value in TSEM's
policy/model enforcement, it seems like this is something that one
would want to address.

The integrity digest caching functionality isn't a security policy,
it's a cache that improves integrity measurements/verifications in
some use cases.  It's an implementation improvement, not a security
model.

My argument was that TSEM was putting forth unordered measurements as
a solution to all that ails existing ordered measurement solutions, so
it made little sense to include ordered measurements if the TSEM
solution was superior.  I think the reality is that unordered
measurements look appealing on paper, and perhaps even have a few use
cases that can leverage these benefits without having to worry about
the downsides, but they aren't going to be a reasonable solution for a
large number of use cases.  This raises a question of why include
both?  The unordered approach may be novel, but is it applicable
enough to warrant the added complexity?

I agree that generally speaking the less tuning knobs to get wrong,
the better.  However, that assumes a system that can adjust itself as
necessary to ensure a reasonable level of operation.  If TSEM can not
dynamically adjust itself you should consider exposing those tunables.
