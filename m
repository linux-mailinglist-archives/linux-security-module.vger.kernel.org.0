Firstly, thank you for taking the time to respond and explain. I can see
where you are coming from.

Yeah, admittedly I did make a few assumptions. I was thrown by the referenc=
e
to `unprivileged` processes in the cover letter. It seems like this is a wa=
y to
grant namespaced BPF permissions to a process (my gross
oversimplification - sorry).
Looking back throughout your responses there's nothing unprivileged here.

I appreciate your viewpoint. I just don't think that this is a one
solution fits every
scenario situation. For example in the case of AF_XDP, I'd like to be
able to run
my containers without any additional privileges. I've been working on a dev=
ice
plugin for Kubernetes whose job is to provision netdevs with an XDP redirec=
t
program (then later there's a CNI that moves the netdev into the pod networ=
k
namespace).  Originally I was using bpf locally in the device plugin
(to load the
bpf program and get the XSK map fd) and SCM rights to pass the XSK_MAP over
UDS but honestly it was relatively cumbersome from an app development POV, =
very
easy to get wrong, and trying to keep up with the latest bpf api
changes started to
become an issue. If I wanted to add more interesting bpf programs I
had to do a full
recompile...

I've now moved to using bpfd, for the loading and unloading of the bpf
program on my behalf,
it also comes with a bunch of other advantages including being able to
update my trusted bpf
program transparently to both the device plugin my application (I
don't have to respin this either
when I write/want to add a new bpf prog), but mainly I have a trusted
proxy managing bpffs, bpf progs and maps for me. There's still more
work to do here...

I understand this is a much simplified scenario. and I'm sure I can
think of several more where
proxy is useful. All I'm trying to say is, I'm not sure there's just a
one size fits all soln for these issues.

Thanks
Maryam
