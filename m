OK, that is weird, I got this one some time later.

It's implemented in 16/24:

I went through the patch, and yes, they can be migrated to 16/24.
I agree with this, no excuses.

In 16/24 pages are added to sgx_active_page_list from which they are
swapped by the reclaimer to the main memory when Enclave Page Cache
(EPC), the memory where enclave pages reside, gets full.

When a reclaimer thread takes a victim page from that list, it will also
get a kref to the enclave so that struct sgx_encl instance does not
get wiped while it's doing its job.

I guess I answered that, and I also fully agree with your suggestions.

It used to be many iterations ago that enclaves were not file based but
just memory mappings (long story short: was not great way to make them
multiprocess, that's why file centered now), and then refcount played a
bigger role. Having those "extras" in this patch is by no means
intentional but more like cruft of many iterations of refactoring.

Sometimes when you work long with this kind of pile of code, which has
converged through many iterations, you really need someone else to point
some of the simple and obvious things out.

It's 15/24.

I think that having just "sgx_enclave" and "sgx_provision" would be
better.

I've been thinking about this for a while but at the same time try not
to be too proactive without feedback. One reason would be that "enclave"
and "provision" without the subdir are not good identifiers.

I also recalled this discussion:

https://lkml.org/lkml/2019/12/23/158

and was wondering how that subdir would even play with /sys/class/misc,
if we decide to add attributes? Not enough knowledge to answer this.

Anyway, I'll put a note to my backlog on this, and also to move the
previously discussed cruft to the correct patch.
