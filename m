Hi Prakhar,

The patch/patch set title in the Subject line should not explain "how"
you add a new feature.  In this case an appropriate patch set title
would be, "Add support for measuring the boot command line".
 Similarly, the first patch in this patch set could be named "Define a
new IMA hook to measure the boot command line arguments".

When mentoring, I suggest starting out with a simple status statement
(eg. "The kexec boot command line arguments are not currently being
measured."), followed by the problem statement in the first paragraph.

Secure boot enforces local file data integrity.  The term here should
be "trusted boot attestation".

The original version of this patch set included the kernel version.  
This version is just measuring the boot command line arguments.

Until per policy template field rule support is added, a template name
needs to be defined.  Please define "ima-buf" as:
{.name = "ima-buf", .fmt = "d-ng|n-ng|buf"}

I'm still seeing some scripts/checkpatch "WARNING: line over 80
characters".  scripts/Lindent should provide the correct way of
formatting these lines.

Some people feel that references to Lindent should be removed, but I
tend to agree with the Documentation/hwmon/submitting-patches.rst
comment pertaining to scripts/Lindent.

"* Running your patch or driver file(s) through checkpatch does not
mean its formatting is clean. If unsure about formatting in your new
driver, run it through Lindent. Lindent is not perfect, and you may
have to do some minor cleanup, but it is a good start."

Examples of where the line formatting is off is the call to
ima_get_action() in process_buffer_measurement() and the call to
process_buffer_measurement() in ima_kexec_cmdline().

thanks,

Mimi
