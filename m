[This email was generated by a script.  Let me know if you have any suggestions
to make it better, or if you want it re-generated with the latest status.]

Of the currently open syzbot reports against the upstream kernel, I've manually
marked 2 of them as possibly being bugs in the "security/tomoyo" subsystem. 
I've listed these reports below, sorted by an algorithm that tries to list first
the reports most likely to be still valid, important, and actionable.

If you believe a bug is no longer valid, please close the syzbot report by
sending a '#syz fix', '#syz dup', or '#syz invalid' command in reply to the
original thread, as explained at https://goo.gl/tpsmEJ#status

If you believe I misattributed a bug to the "security/tomoyo" subsystem, please
let me know, and if possible forward the report to the correct people or mailing
list.

Here are the bugs:
