Perhaps I didn't do a very good job explaining my concern, or it got a
little twisted as the thread went on (likely due to my use of
"duplication"), but my concern wasn't so much that
access_override_creds() or the proposed access_need_override_creds()
duplicates code elsewhere, it was that the proposed
access_need_override_creds() function is a separate check from the
code which is actually responsible for doing the credential fixup for
AT_EACCESS.  I'm worried about a subtle change in one function not
being reflected in the other and causing an access control bug.

Possibly, and the comment should help.

Although I'm looking at this again and realized that only
do_faccessat() calls access_override_creds(), so why not just fold the
new access_need_override_creds() logic into access_override_creds()?
Just have one function that takes the flag value, and returns an
old_cred/NULL pointer (or pass old_cred to the function by reference
and return an error code); that should still provide the performance
win Mateusz is looking for while providing additional safety against
out-of-sync changes.  I would guess the code would be smaller too.

You're probably right.  As I said earlier, I'm just really sensitive
to code that is vulnerable to going out of sync like this and I try to
avoid it whenever possible.
