As the subject line indicates, this is the kexec boot command line.

This wouldn't be any different than the existing
kernel_read_file_from_fd() and security_kernel_load_data() calls in
kernel/kexec_file.c and  kernel/kexec.c, which provides the LSMs an
opportunity to comment on the kexec image and initramfs.
