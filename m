Please start the cover letter with the problem description/motivation, not the
solution.

From https://docs.kernel.org/process/submitting-patches.html: 

"Describe your problem. Whether your patch is a one-line bug fix or 5000 lines
of a new feature, there must be an underlying problem that motivated you to do
this work. Convince the reviewer that there is a problem worth fixing and that
it makes sense for them to read past the first paragraph."

For example,

Additional keys not built into the kernel could originally be loaded onto the
.secondary_trusted_keyring *only* if they were signed by a key built into the
kernel or by a key already on the .secondary_trusted_keyring.  The concern for
using the wrong key for signature verification was minimal.  With the ability of
loading Machine Owner Keys(MOK) keys onto the .machine keyring, which is linked
to the .secondary_trusted_keys keyring, key usage is a real concern.

To limit key usage ...

Keys stored on the .builtin_trusted_keys keyring seem to always be permitted,
independent of a Clavis rule, which is fine, but the above paragraph needs to be
re-worded.

Move this paragraph (and patch) to later.  Defining a new UEFI variable makes it
more difficult to test.  Consider defering introducing the new UEFI variable
patch to the end.

Ok. To summarize, the Clavis policy rules are loaded at runtime onto the .clavis
keyring.  The Clavis rules must be signed by the key specified on the "clavis="
boot command line.  The only key on the .clavis keyring is the one specified on
the boot command line.

As far as I'm aware, this would be the first time policy rules are stored in a
keyring.

Being able to at least limit the key used to verify the IMA policy signature
would be nice to have earlier, rather than later.

I don't see a problem with trusting the builtin keys.  They should be trusted.

Additional comments:

This patch set is dependent on CONFIG_{MODULE, KEXEC}_SIG being enabled:

- with CONFIG_MODULE_SIG_FORCE and CONFIG_KEXEC_SIG_FORCE configured.
- wit sig_enforce specified on the boot command line.
- with either Lockdown or CONFIG_IMA_ARCH_POLICY enforcing kexec/module
signature verification.

Without CONFIG_{MODULE, KEXEC}_SIG enabled and with CONFIG_IMA_ARCH_POLICY
enabled or similar rules, IMA would verify the kexec kernel image and kernel
modules without Clavis enforcement.
