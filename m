I suppose it doesn't have to be temporary.  I was trying not to introduce
another keyring within system_keyring code.

I just want to make sure I understand. If we kept the .mok keyring around,=
=20
we would store it into the system_keyring code, just like the platform=20
keyring is stored.  This would allow the move exemption code to be removed.
If the mok keyring is a new trust source, whenever the secondary keyring=20
is referenced in verify_ code, the mok keyring will be checked too.  If=20
I have this right, let me know and I=E2=80=99ll work on a v2.  Thanks.
