A running number of bytes needed for carrying the measurement list
across kexec already exists.  This value would be affected when the
measurement list is trimmed.

<securityfs>/ima/runtime_measurements_count already exports the total
number of measurement records.

Other critical data is calculated, before calling
ima_measure_critical_data(), which adds the record to the measurement
list and extends the TPM PCR.

Signing the hash shouldn't be an issue if it behaves like other
critical data.

In addition to the hash, consider including other information in the
new critical data record (e.g. total number of measurement records, the
number of measurements included in the hash, the number of times the
measurement list was trimmed, etc).

The problem isn't the "snapshot_aggregate" critical data record per-se, 
but pausing adding measurements to the IMA measurement list and
extending the PCR to calculate it.

(Perhaps including other information, like the number of IMA
measurements before or after reading each TPM PCR read, would eliminate
the need for pausing the measurement list.)

Yes, I saw.  This might be a good place, as you suggested, "to have a
brief discussion
of how userspace might use a kernel feature".  Perhaps rename this
thread to differentiate it from the kernel design.
