In that case, I think it might be best to wrap up this thread and we
can resume the discussion on the next patchset.

The canonical guidance on coding style within the kernel is in the kernel d=
ocs:

https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html

When in doubt, I would recommend following that as closely as possible.

As far as local variable ordering is concerned, I don't believe I've
ever rejected patches due to that.  My own personal preference usually
follows what you've described above: the least complex (simple
scalars) at the top, with the more complex variables (composites) at
the bottom.  In practice this tends to result in a "Christmas Tree"
ordering, but it can be a bit lumpy (?) in some cases; that is fine.

There are two style nitpicks which annoy me enough to make it worth mention=
ing:

* Stick to 80 characters as much as possible, yes we all have
terminals that can go wider, but I like to have several terminals on
my screen and if they all need to be 100 chars wide I can't fit as
many.  There are going to be some exceptions, e.g. error message
string literals, but that should only happen a few times in a given
file.  If you are finding that every function you write has a line
that goes past 80 characters you are doing *something* wrong.

* If/when you split a single line across multiple lines due to the
above, make sure the
lines are indented properly such that they line up properly with the
code above.  It's tricky to give all of the different examples so I'm
not going to even try.  I realize that is garbage guidance, but the
kernel coding style is a help here.

If you are really lost, I use the following 'astyle' command in other
projects, and it should produce fairly kernel-style friendly code:

% astyle --options=3Dnone --lineend=3Dlinux --mode=3Dc \
    --style=3Dlinux \
    --indent=3Dforce-tab=3D8 \
    --indent-preprocessor \
    --indent-col1-comments \
    --min-conditional-indent=3D0 \
    --max-instatement-indent=3D80 \
    --pad-oper \
    --align-pointer=3Dname \
    --align-reference=3Dname \
    --max-code-length=3D80 \
    --break-after-logical
