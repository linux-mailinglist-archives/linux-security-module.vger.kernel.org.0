Okay, so why would anyone use mutable data with IMA appraise if it corrupts your
files by design, both with and without this patchset?

On what storage devices, workloads, and filesystems is this number for?

Filesystems implement consistency mechanisms, e.g. journalling or copy-on-write,
to recover from crashes by design.  This patchset doesn't implement or use any
such mechanism, so it's not crash-safe.  It's not clear that it's even a step in
the right direction, as no patches have been proposed for a correct solution so
we can see what it actually involves.
