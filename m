Hello Alejandro!

For context, in this patch set, we have three commits:

  * 1/3 and 2/3 copy documentation from the kernel side unmodified.
  * 3/3 revises a section about Landlock's "scoped" restriction features.

I thought it would be easier to discuss with the "copy" and "rewrite" parts
separate, but actually, as you also noticed, 3/3 does rewrite large chunks =
of
the 2/3 commit along the way, and it is probably not worth correcting much =
of
that wording any more.

Would you prefer if I squashed commits 2/3 and 3/3 into one?

Thanks, this is useful.  Changed it to infinitive for now.

FWIW, the same phrases exist on the kernel side as well, unfortunately.

I added it to my notes for further revisions,
I think this would indeed be more appropriate in the man pages.

Is it possible to set the paranthetical without bold as well,
even in a .SS subsection header?

It refers to the sandboxed process.

This correction would be overwritten in the following commit.
I don't think it's worth fixing any more.

It is a typo, copied from kernel documentation.  Oops.

This correction is overwritten in the following commit.

Done.

Done.

Thanks for the review,
