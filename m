Yes, that all matches exactly what I was trying to say. FWIW, I might be
way too naive, but I would expect two categories of existing verifier
behaviors:
- "Real" ones like keylime or so, which are being asked to verify
  against a single specific bank and the result is either yes or no with
  no inbetween.  In particular, these wouldn't fallback to checking
  whether something else like padded SHA1s would perhaps verify.
- The ones more in the development/debugging/testsuite realm, which
  would attempt to verify against all banks and fail (the test?) if any
  does not verify. These would try harder to avoid false negatives by
  testing for the alternatives like padded SHA1s as well. I suppose
  ima-evm-utils' ima_measurement would qualify as such one.

For the first class, simply invalidating the unsupported PCR banks
somehow, i.e. option a.), is good enough. For the second kind however,
the question is whether something like b.) would be helpful and the
additional complexity on the kernel side warranted. But agreed, it's a
partial and best-effort solution. If one kexecs into a kernel with a
proper subset of supported TPM bank hashes, it wouldnt't work.

As the boot aggregate gets extended already at that point in time
(IIRC), I'd expect that reading the PCRs would probably succeed as
well. For the delays imposed on the kexec restore path -- I can't tell
unfortunately. But I would only do it on kexec restore if the
measurement list is non-empty anyway, so systems not having IMA enabled
or ones which wouldn't kexec are not affected.

Yes, that would work as well. IIUC, it would mean that we would
e.g. extend truncated SHA-256 template hashes into a SHA-1 bank, right?
However, since no existing tool like 'ima_measurement' is expecting
that, and would fail a verification then, I'm currently struggling to
see the advantage over just doing a.) and invalidating the PCR banks
with a fixed value right away?

That's true, but when invalidating unsupported banks with a single ff
... ff, one could successfully verify a measurement list having only a
single violation entry against an invalidated bank AFAICS. I think it
would be more robust to use a different constant for the invalidation.

Thanks!
