Please include a proper justification for this feature and update the relevant
sections of Documentation/filesystems/fscrypt.rst to explain why someone would
want to use this feature and what it accomplishes.

As-is, this feature doesn't seem to have a very strong justification.  Please
also see previous threads where this feature was discussed/requested:
https://lkml.kernel.org/linux-fscrypt/20180110124418.24385-1-git@andred.net/T/#u,
https://lkml.kernel.org/linux-fscrypt/20180118131359.8365-1-git@andred.net/T/#u,
https://lkml.kernel.org/linux-fscrypt/20200116193228.GA266386@vader/T/#u

Note that there are several design flaws with the encrypted and trusted key
types:

- By default, trusted keys are generated using the TPM's RNG rather than the
  kernel's RNG, which places all trust in an unauditable black box.

- trusted and encrypted keys aren't restricted to specific uses in the kernel
  (like the fscrypt-provisioning key type is) but rather are general-purpose.
  Hence, it may be possible to leak their contents to userspace by requesting
  their use for certain algorithms/features, e.g. to encrypt a dm-crypt target
  using a weak cipher that is vulnerable to key recovery attacks.

- "encrypted" keys that use a master key of type "user" are supported, despite
  these being easily obtainable in the clear by userspace providing their own
  master key.  This violates one of the main design goals of "encrypted" keys.

Also, using the "trusted" key type isn't necessary to achieve TPM-bound
encryption, as TPM binding can be handled in userspace instead.

So I really would like to see a proper justification for this feature, and have
it be properly documented.

Why not just allow the key_id field to specify a "trusted" or "encrypted" key?
Why is it necessary for FS_IOC_ADD_ENCRYPTION_KEY to support two different ways
of looking up keyring keys -- by ID and by description?  Looking up by ID works
fine for "fscrypt-provisioning" keys; why are "trusted" and "encrypted" keys
different in this regard?
