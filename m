Making life easier for LSMs by sharing common code is a good thing, but
making life easier for all kernel components by sharing common code is
even better.  The PIDFD_GET_INFO IOCTL was design to be very flexible,
and it follows the principle of "pay for what you request" thanks to the
"mask" bitfield.

Users specify a set of properties they want, and the kernel returns
these properties if they are supported and allowed.  Each of this
property is well-specified and has a clear semantic.  This patch series
implements two Landlock properties, each clearly identified and
independent.

One important difference between the current LSMs attributes and these
two new Landlock properties, is that the Landlock domain IDs are u64
values instead of strings.  This makes the implementation quite forward
and it fits well with how PIDFD_GET_INFO currently works, so there is no
need for a new (PIDFD_GET_SECURITY) IOCTL handling complex data
structure composing a set of strings such as what is required for
current LSMs' attributes.

This effort is good, but it is a separate effort which is independent
from this patch series.  This will be useful for LSMs (or hopefully
other parts of the kernel as well) that deal with string-based
attributes.

Even with a common hook and data structure, any LSM need to implement
their own attribute management.  This patch series just makes a call to
the Landlock implementation the same way UID, cgroupid, and other
properties are retrieved.  There is no need for a wrapper interface for
simple data types that are already handled by PIDFD_GET_INFO.

Simple property types should all be queryable with the PIDFD_GET_INFO
IOCTL (compared to a dedicated LSM's PIDFD_GET_SECURITY IOCTL), which
can batch queries, making it more efficient and easier to implement for
user space.
