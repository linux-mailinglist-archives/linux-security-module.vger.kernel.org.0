Sorry... why not just request a real capability bit be reserved?

Ok, I see at https://lore.kernel.org/all/?q=Luigi%20Semenzato%20capability
that Casey was suitably cautious.  However, I'd say if we end up needing to do
the painful transition to 128bit caps, we should face that, rather than
make people do ugly hacks.
