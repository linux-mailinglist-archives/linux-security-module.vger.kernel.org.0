From a LSM perspective I think we would want to have policy
enforcement points both when task A enables delegation and when task B
makes use of the delegation.  We would likely also want to be able to
add some additional delegation state to the superblock if delegation
was enabled in the first enforcement point.

I'm not too bothered by how that ends up looking from a userspace
perspective, but it seems like requiring an explicit "this fs can be
delegated" step would be a positive from a security perspective.  In
other words, just because a task *could* delegated a filesystem, may
not mean it *wants* to delegate a filesystem.
