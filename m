Below will do it. (I though default at 0 might be better...)

+static unsigned int audit_history_size __ro_after_init = 4096;
+char init_task_audit_history[7680];
+static int __init audit_history_setup(char *str)

+	unsigned int size;

Full pathname is max 4096 bytes. But full command line effectively has no
limit, which might become very long. Shouldn't full command line arguments
be retrieved from execve()'s argv[] record? Since this history information
includes timestamp of execve(), also recording execve() requests will allow
administrators to find the full command line.

I couldn't catch what you are suggesting. Are you suggesting something like

  type=UNKNOWN[1340] msg=audit(1691750738.271:108):
    n[$n]="swapper/0" n[$n+1]="init" n[$n+2]="systemd" n[$n+3]="sshd" n[$n+4]="sshd"
    p[$n]=1 p[$n+1]=1 p[$n+2]=1 p[$n+3]=3660 p[$n+4]=3767
    s[$n]=20230811194329 s[$n+1]=20230811194343 s[$n+2]=20230811194439 s[$n+3]=20230811104504 s[$n+4]=20230811104535

so that value for n[$n] is escaped only when control characters are in use?
