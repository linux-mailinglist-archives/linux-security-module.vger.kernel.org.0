I suppose anyone using mutable data with IMA appraise should, unless
they have a redundant power supply and a kernel that never crashes. In
a way this is like asking if the ima-appraise should be there for
mutable data at all. All this is doing is that it improves the crash
recovery reliability without taking anything away.

Anyway, I think I'm getting along with my understanding of the page
writeback slowly and the journal support will eventually be there at
least as an add-on patch for those that want to use it and really need
the last 0.n% reliability. Note that even without that patch you can
build ima-appraise based systems that are 99.999% reliable just by
having the patch we're discussing here. Without it you would be orders
of magnitude worse off. All we are doing is that we give it a fairly
good chance to recover instead of giving up without even trying.

That said, I'm not sure the 100% crash recovery is ever guaranteed in
any Linux system. We just have to do what we can, no?
