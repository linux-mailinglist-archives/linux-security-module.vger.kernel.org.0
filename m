It looks like this was posted about a month before I became
responsible for the LSM layer as a whole, and likely was lost (at
least on the LSM side of things) as a result.

I would much rather see a standalone fix to address the unintended LSM
interactions, then the static call performance improvements in a
separate patchset.
