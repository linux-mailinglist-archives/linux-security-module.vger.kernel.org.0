Thanks!

I think that yes, non-device files should be able to receive the
LANDLOCK_ACCESS_FS_IOCTL_DEV right.  I played through some examples to
ponder this:

It should be possible to grant this access right on a file hierarchy,
for example on /dev/bus/usb to permit IOCTLs on all USB devices.

But such directories can also be empty (e.g. no USB devices plugged
in)!  Asking user space Landlock users to traverse /dev/bus/usb to
look for device files before using Landlock would needlessly
complicate the API, and it would be a race condition anyway, because
devices files can disappear at any time later as well (by unplugging
your mouse and keyboard).

So when applies to a directory, the LANDLOCK_ACCESS_FS_IOCTL_DEV right
already inherently needs to deal with cases where there is not a
single device file within the directory.  (But there can technically
be other files.)

So if the access right can be granted on any directory (with or
without device files), it seems inconsistent that the requirements for
using it on a file within that hierarchy should be stricter than that.

Another data point:

This would also be consistent with the LANDLOCK_ACCESS_FS_EXECUTE
right: This access right only has an effect on files that are marked
executable in the first place, yet the access right can be granted on
non-executable files as well.

To sum up:

* It seems harmless to permit, and the name of the access rights
  already spells out that it has no effect on non-device files.

* It frees the user space libraries from doing up-front file type
  checks.

* It would be consistent with how the access right can be granted on a
  directory (where it really needs to be more flexible, as discussed
  above).

* The LANDLOCK_ACCESS_FS_EXECUTE right has not been a point of
  confusion so far, even though is has similar semantics.

So yes, I think it should be possible to use this access right on
non-device files as well.

Thanks, good point.

I'll add the Google copyright and will also retroactively add the
copyright for the truncate contributions going back to 2022.
