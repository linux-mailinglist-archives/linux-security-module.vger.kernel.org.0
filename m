I checked better when the random key would be used to verify files
created during the boot. If we consider rootfs only, basically it would
be used for dracut-state.sh.

Before I was using a rule to measure digest lists in tmpfs. I had many
errors due to the fact that appraisal denied access to files in /run.
The default policy does not appraise files in tmpfs, and also for digest
lists it is not necessary (now I use: measure/appraise fsname=rootfs).

The goal of appraisal is to allow access only to files with a valid
signature or HMAC. With the current behavior, that cannot be guaranteed.

Unfortunately, dracut-state.sh is created very early. It could be
possible to unseal the key before, but this probably means modifying
systemd.
