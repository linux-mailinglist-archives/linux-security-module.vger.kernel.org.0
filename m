What exactly is "trust boundary"? And what do you mean when you say that
Linux "trusts" something? AFAIK, software does not have feelings. Please,
just speak about exact things.

That's the whole point of the cover letter. It's better to not have cover
letter at all, than a confusing cover letter that reads like a white paper.
Code changes at least tell the exact story, and not speak about feelings.

I use a pre-compiled kernel in my desktop: https://liquorix.net/. When
a new version comes up it requires a sbsign one-liner to sign it for
secure boot. I'm wondering what is the problem I'm facing because I do
not see it.

If there are something missing changes that you use as a rationale for
this large patch set, you should at least broadly explain what we are
missing. How I conclude this paragraph is that, since there is only an
xref, they are not really "that important" changes, which are missing.

Which both can be done by end-user as of today, or I'm misreading this.

What is IMA appraisal? I just don't know it because I don't use IMA.
Again, this trust boundary is really something I do not. Looking at
code changes, you could just speak about exact assets in the kernel.

OK, changes are described here (again speaking about trusting tho). The
motivation part is missing. The text before this is more like confusion
part. When you describe motivation to do something you should really be in
grass roots, e.g. "when you have this feature in the kernel, look, I can
do now this". It's not that hard. E.g. with an usage example it is quite
quick accomplish this.
