Agreed, this would be the change that would let us restrict connect()
on AF_UNIX sockets.

Additionally, *in the case that you do not actually need* Unix
sockets, the other patch set that would be of interest is the one for
restricting the creation of new socket FDs:
https://github.com/landlock-lsm/linux/issues/6

In this talk in 2014, I explained my mental model around the
network-related restrictions:
https://youtu.be/K2onopkMhuM?si=LCObEX6HhGdzPnks&t=2030

The discussed socket control feature continues to be a central missing
piece, as the TCP port restrictions do not make much sense as long as
you can still create sockets for other protocol types.

Issue #6 that should fix this is still under active development -- an
updated version of the patch was posted just last month.

To bridge the gap, the same thing can also be emulated with seccomp,
but as you noted above as well in this thread, this is harder.
