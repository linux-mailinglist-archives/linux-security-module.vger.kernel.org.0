I'm not opposing to identifying LSMs via a token value. I'm opposing to who can
obtain a token value, for I haven't heard a clear promise that we shall allow
whatever LSM modules to obtain a token value.

Who can obtain a token value affects both built-in LSM modules and dynamically
loadable LSM modules. A "code that is being developed in the open with the
*intention* to be submitted to be in-tree" has to be able to obtain a token
value as soon as starting development (which is much earlier stage than getting
that code in-tree).

Do you remember that you said

If in-tree kernel refuses to assign a token value, no new LSM module would be developed
in the open, for not-yet-in-tree code (in whatever stage) cannot use a token value for
registering into the LSM framework.

And even if a "code is being developed in the open with the intention to be
submitted to be in-tree, and actually submitted for in-tree", we know that we
cannot accept all submitted LSM modules. LSM modules which were not accepted for
in-tree have to remain out-of-tree.

We don't make patches for out-of-tree code in order to catch up to upstream kernel
changes. But we didn't and must not try to forbid out-of-tree code to exist.

Although I'm not a fan of proprietary / closed source code, I have to resist
Casey's attempt to lock out out-of-tree code and new code.

Never settled, unless you all promise that we shall assign a token value to whatever
LSM modules (regardless of whether that LSM module is already in-tree or not).
