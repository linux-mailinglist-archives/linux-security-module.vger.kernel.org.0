I like this guideline. I guess this is your goal and I think it should
be part of Documentation/security/lsm.rst (and move the introduction
part of lsm-development.rst into lsm.rst) and get a few SoB.

Why "generally"?

We should also avoid falling in the other extreme which is to add
different argument just-in-case. For instance, there is no need to add a
"flags" argument to a kernel API if there is no flag for now, especially
if there are only a few users of this hook.

I would say that we want generic-as-possible hooks (e.g. well
positioned) but not with useless arguments.

To avoid misunderstanding, I think it would be better and more generic
to focus on the out-of-tree nature of hook implementations.  We might
also want to give some pointers for the reason(s) why out-of-tree LSMs
use cases are not supported.

If we go for a kernel documentation patch, it might be better to put
most of this historic paragraph into the patch description.

I guess defining the threat model would be a good first step (and we
should probably add this kind of description for current LSMs as well).

I would also add tests! For new kernel developments, especially those
focused on security, the interfaces should be well tested, part of
kselftests, and run at least for each kernel release (if possible with
the KernelCI infrastructure).  A good test coverage should be a minimal
requirement, even if this is not enough.  Additionally, syzkaller should
be able to efficiently fuzz these interfaces, which may require some
tuning.

Extending the kernel documentation should not stop developers to write
man pages as well. ;)

It might also be useful to add some standalone tools in samples/
