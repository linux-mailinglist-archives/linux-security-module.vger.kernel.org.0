Okay, will do.  Just a heads up that due to personal commitments this
weekend a proper, tested fix may not come until early next week.  With
this only appearing in Linus' tree during this merge window we've got
plenty of time to fix this before v6.8 is tagged.

This would also give people an opportunity to point out any flaws in
my thinking - in particular I'm looking at you other LSM folks.

Sure.

Yeah, easy enough.  I was originally thinking of masking out
REQ_F_CREDS there, but if you are okay with simply rejecting the
operation in this case it makes everything much easier (and more
predictable from a userspace perspective).

Agreed.  I'll go ahead and make the change.  Thanks for the quick
responses and understanding of a very security-biased perspective :)
