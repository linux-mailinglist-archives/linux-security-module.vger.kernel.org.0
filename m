The RAND column is probably misnamed, it doesn't really imply random
in the common sense of the meaning.  It implies that a 256 bit nonce
(keyid) can be supplied to the ENCLU[EGETKEY] instruction to perturb
the key derivation process.

The value is actually available in plaintext form as part of the
metadata for sealed data.

If it was really a random value, attestation wouldn't work.

All of this discussion has lacked a certain amount of precision, as a
result the original issue with respect to Dave's concern regarding the
privacy implications of an enclave posessing the PROVISION_KEY
attribute has been lost.

First of all, it is important to note that two types of attestation
are available, EPID and DCAP/ECDSA.  They differ in their
implementation with respect to which enclaves need to have access to
derivation of the PROVISION_KEY.  What does remain constant is the
role that the PROVISION_KEY plays in all this.

The Platform Certification Enclave (PCE) has two roles:

1.) Generate a Platform Provisioning IDentifier (PPID).

2.) Certification of the fact that an enclave, other then the PCE, is
running on the same platform at a particular Trusted Computing Base
(TCB) level.

Being able to generate a PPID is the most privacy sensitive operation
that an enclave can peform, hence the recommendation to restrict
access to the attribute bit that allows an enclave to create a
derivation of the root provisioning key.

The PPID is a 256 bit symmetric key that is generated with the keyid
and security version values all set to null values.  As a result, any
enclave with a given MRSIGNER value will generate the same key value.
That value is used by Intel, and potentially others, to uniquely
identify the platform as long as it exists.

The PPID can be admixed with other information, such as the platform
security version of an enclave, to create a unique identifier for the
TCB state of enclave based software running on a particular platform.
This is role 2 of the PCE that I noted above.

In DCAP attestation, which is what Jarkko is referring to, both the
Quoting Enclave (QE) and PCE have access to PROVISION_KEY derivation.

In EPID attestation the PCE and the Provisioning Enclave (PVE) have
access to PROVISION_KEY derivation.

I guess it is up to community consensus as to whether or not this is a
privacy/security sensitive issue.  It provides precise enough
identification that Intel uses it to determine whether or not a
platform should be allowed or denied the ability to participate in
EPID attestation.

I believe that this is being used to to force the cloud based
platforms to use DCAP rather then EPID based attestation.  The
provision keys for these SKU's are not included in the Intel
Attestation Service (IAS) database so they cannot identify themselves
for provisioning of an EPID private key.

Since Intel has access to the root provisioning keys it can identify a
platform a-priori.  Other entities can use this infrastructure for
uniquely identifying platforms but it has to be done via an enrollment
process for a given signing key.

Hopefully the above clarifications are helpful.

Have a good day.
