It's more than 'best practices'. You need a well-known config file with 
well-known config options in it.

All clients that were previously just trying to read new bytes from the 
IMA log cannot do this anymore in the presence of a log shard producer 
but have to also learn that a new log shard has been produced so they 
need to figure out the new position in the log where to read from. So 
maybe a counter in a config file should indicate to the log readers that 
a new log has been produced -- otherwise they would have to monitor all 
the log shard files or the log shard file's size.

Iff the log-shard producer were configured to discard leading parts of 
the log then that should also be noted in a config file so clients, that 
need to see the beginning of the log, can refuse early on to work on a 
machine that either is configured this way or where the discarding has 
already happened.
