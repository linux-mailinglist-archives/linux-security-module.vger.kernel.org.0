I understand being "FIPS certified" embedding the premise that kernel
is also FIPS certified, which covers also crypto etc. This is the case
with enterprise kernels.

I have understanding FIPS certification dies at the point when random
data is acquired by a kernel, which is not FIPS certified. It's not 
really a safe closure.

Using same code path for RNG universally should actually help with any
certification processes.

I don't disagree on benefits of FIPS certification.

Generally removing any non-mandatory TPM traffic is a feasible idea.

This was just something low-hanging fruit that I spotted while working
on larger patch set.
