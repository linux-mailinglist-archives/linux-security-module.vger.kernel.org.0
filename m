I didn't dig the detailed history of LSM stacking, but you are in Cc
because I know that you know. I may have though that the main goal of
the current LSM stacking implementation was to enable to stack existing
LSMs, which works well with this CONFIG_LSM list, but doesn't work as
well for new LSMs.

Yes, and it doesn't change much the current behavior without user
interaction. However, it gives the choice to users to choose how they
want their configuration to evolve.

This patch series doesn't change this behavior if the user doesn't want
it to change.

What is the next phase of module stacking? What would be the consequences?

Systems will only get new LSMs if their configuration said so, either
from Kconfig or from boot arguments. I think we should make easier to
have a working, consistent and secure kernel configuration by default.
If users want to have a non-default configuration, that's fine, fully
supported, and they can do it.

This is indeed the intent of this patch, but this configuration is optional.

Why? Generic kernels can be configured with CONFIG_LSM or with
CONFIG_LSM_AUTO. I agree that generic distros may want to not enable
major LSMs such as SELinux, AppArmor, Smack and Tomoyo by default but
support them in their generic kernel anyway to let users pick and
configure an LSM thanks to the boot arguments, and that's totally fine.
Moreover, distro maintainers will surely browse most of new options to
identify if it is the best choice for their distro. The *default* choice
(for LSMs enabled at boot) is in the hand of users configuring their
kernel, and they are in the best position to choose if they want to
follow new kernel options and their consequences (e.g. distro kernel
maintainers, whose job is to follow kernel development), or to have an
easier way to maintain an up-to-date kernel (e.g. sysadmins or
hobbyists, who may not have so much time dedicated to follow kernel
developments).

Nothing is silently added to the user configuration with this patch. It
is an optional (default) configuration, which I think makes more sense
for users not expert in every kernel toggles.
