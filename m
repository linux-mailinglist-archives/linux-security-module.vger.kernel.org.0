Hi Paul,

that's alright, I was mainly asking the Rust for Linux contributors for feedback
on that, but I wanted to keep you in the loop as well.

thanks for the feedback, I guess I was missing some context in the initial mail.
The LSM I'm using it for in my thesis is more of a research testbed (or "demo"),
so I never intended to upstream that. Since I still needed to create bindings to
implement that in Rust, I figured I would post them to the lists to get some
feedback and to get things started in case someone wants to implement an actual
upstreamed LSM in Rust in the future. This is why I marked this "RFC PATCH", it
is not intended for upstreaming, only for feedback.

If there is interest in it, I might polish the bindings after the thesis, so
that they can be properly used for an actual LSM. In the state they are
currently in they do allow writing an LSM in Rust, but not in a way a safe Rust
abstraction should.

Thanks,
Lukas
