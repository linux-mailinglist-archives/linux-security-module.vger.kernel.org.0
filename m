Hmm, it's not exactly to regain the "refer" right because there is no 
issue when it is handled by the ruleset/layer.

I pushed this patch with some rephrasing in -next Monday: 
https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/mic/linux.git/commit/?h=next&id=7e4c602a992a7cb635ae0c87f5ec2e49136f620c
I can still improve the description though. I plan to send it to Linus 
very soon.
