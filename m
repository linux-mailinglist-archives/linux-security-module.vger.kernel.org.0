KVM, Hyper-V and Xen mailing lists are CCed. The KVM hypercalls are 
specific to KVM, but this patch series also include a common guest API 
intended to be used with all hypervisors.

We're also working on Hyper-V.

What do you mean? We plan to support dynamic code, and performance is of 
course part of the requirement.

This patch series is dedicated to KVM. Windows VBS was only mentioned as 
a comparable (but much more advanced) set of features. Everything 
required to use this new KVM features is and will be open-source. There 
is nothing to worry about licensing, the goal is to make it widely and 
freely available to protect users.

It's on my todo list, but again, that should not be an issue and I even 
doubt the difference to be measurable.
