Okay, I understand now. Sorry for frustrating you! By "way forward",
I meant I didn't understand how to address what looked like conflicting
feedback. I think my confusion was over separating the goal ("this
feature should be automatically enabled when it is known to be useful")
from an interpretation of earlier feedback as "I don't want a CONFIG [that
leaves this up to the user]", when what you really wanted understood was
"I don't want a CONFIG *ever*, regardless of whether it picks the correct
setting automatically".

Agreed. :) Anyway, when you do review it, I think you can just ignore
patch 5, and if a v9 isn't needed, a brand new patch for that logic can
be created later.
