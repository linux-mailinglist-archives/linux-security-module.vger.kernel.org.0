Side note, and this is not really related to this particular patch
other than because it just brought up the issue once more..

Our "kernel_cap_t" thing is disgusting.

It's been a structure containing

        __u32 cap[_KERNEL_CAPABILITY_U32S];

basically forever, and it's not likely to change in the future. I
would object to any crazy capability expansion, considering how
useless and painful they've been anyway, and I don't think anybody
really is even remotely planning anything like that anyway.

And what is _KERNEL_CAPABILITY_U32S anyway? It's the "third version"
of that size:

  #define _KERNEL_CAPABILITY_U32S    _LINUX_CAPABILITY_U32S_3

which happens to be the same number as the second version of said
#define, which happens to be "2".

In other words, that fancy array is just 64 bits. And we'd probably be
better off just treating it as such, and just doing

        typedef u64 kernel_cap_t;

since we have to do the special "convert from user space format"
_anyway_, and this isn't something that is shared to user space as-is.

Then that "cap_isidentical()" would literally be just "a =3D=3D b" instead
of us playing games with for-loops that are just two wide, and a
compiler that may or may not realize.

It would literally remove some of the insanity in <linux/capability.h>
- look for CAP_TO_MASK() and CAP_TO_INDEX and CAP_FS_MASK_B0 and
CAP_FS_MASK_B1 and just plain ugliness that comes from this entirely
historical oddity.

Yes, yes, we started out having it be a single-word array, and yes,
the code is written to think that it might some day be expanded past
the two words it then in 2008 it expanded to two words and 64 bits.
And now, fifteen years later, we use 40 of those 64 bits, and
hopefully we'll never add another one.

So we have historical reasons for why our kernel_cap_t is so odd. But
it *is* odd.

Hmm?
