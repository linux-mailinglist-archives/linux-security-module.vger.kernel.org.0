OK, I'll add it in the cover letter; something along the lines of:


An example would be a guest performing computations on encrypted files.
 The Guest Owner provides the decryption key (= secret) using the secret
injection mechanism.  The guest application reads the secret from the
sev_secret filesystem and proceeds to decrypt the files into memory and
then performs the needed computations on the content.

Host can't read the files from the disk image because they are
encrypted. Host can't read the decryption key because it is passed using
the secret injection mechanism (= secure channel). Host can't read the
decrypted content from memory because it's a confidential
(memory-encrypted) guest.

On one hand, I agree.  This entire series has no SEV-specific code (but
I tested it only on SEV).

On the other hand, secret injection mechanisms in SEV-SNP and TDX are
different beasts than the one used here (SEV).  In SEV the secrets must
be injected at VM launch time; so when OVMF runs and kernel efistub runs
the secrets are already there (patches 1+2).  However, in SNP there's no
secret injection at launch; (/me hand-waving) the guest can securely
talk with the PSP hardware, check the attestation, and if OK then
securely contact some Guest Owner secret provider to get the required
secrets.  Not sure it makes sense for the kernel to be part of this
"getting secrets from secret provider and exposing them in securityfs".

So maybe for regular SEV we'll use this sev_secret module to get one
secret which will allow the guest to contact to the Guest Owner secret
provider (and from here continue like SNP or TDX).  Brijesh (AMD) also
suggested collapsing the proposed sev_secret module into the new
sev-guest module ("[PATCH Part1 RFC v3 22/22] virt: Add SEV-SNP guest
driver", sent 2021-06-02), and the logic suggested here will be used
when SNP is not active.

Or taking a step back: Maybe the kernel should not try to unify
SEV/SEV-SNP/TDX/PEF/s390x-SE.  Each should have its own API.  A
userspace process will have to understand what is available and get the
required info to run the application in a confidential environment.

Or maybe we can find an API that fits all these confidential computing
mechanisms and expose a unified API that hides the underlying
implementation.

(I'm not really sure - that's the reason this is an RFC series.)

When I wrote this I didn't yet encounter "coco" as an abbreviation. Now
there's a linux-coco mailing list, but I saw no other mentions of it in
the kernel (as an abbreviation for confidential computing).

I agree that the full term is too long; I considered conf-comp (but in
my mind "conf" is short for "configuration").  I used it in one place:
"ConfCompSecret" in patch 2/3.

If as a community we settle on coco / CoCo / COCO then I agree these
should be renamed.

(in QEMU they use CGS = Confidential Guest Support [1].)
