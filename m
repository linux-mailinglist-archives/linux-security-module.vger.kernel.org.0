Following the discussion here (and in various other meetings), the next
version of this patch series will keep the securityfs interface but will
introduce an unlink operation for the securityfs entries that will do
the following:

1. Remove the file entry from the securityfs dir

2. Overwrite the secret data memory (memzero_explicit)

3. Overwrite the GUID in the data memory with some invalid GUID
(ffffffff-ffff-.... ?), so that if the module is removed and loaded
again, the securityfs dir will not contain this entry (we'll ignore
these invalid GUIDs in the iteration).
