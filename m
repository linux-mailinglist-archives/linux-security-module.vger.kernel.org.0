Regardless if you merge the patch series now in 7.0 or a later version, I think there is something to be said
about having the filesystem and scoped unix access right merged in the same ABI version / merge window.

As you pointed out earlier, the combination of the two flags is much flexible and useful to userspace
consumers than one or the other, and if the features were merged separately, there would be an
awkward middle ABI where user space consumers may have to make compromises or changes to
sandbox between different versions or change application behavior.

I think the discussion has died down on the security_unix_find hook for
LANDLOCK_ACCESS_FS_RESOLVE_UNIX [1] [2], and it seemed the general consensus was favorable.

The series for LANDLOCK_ACCESS_FS_RESOLVE_UNIX is pretty small, and feedback on the last version
was pretty quiet as well. So maybe it's worth a final look into. [3]

(PS: I do think if they are merged together, there should be tests specifically for the combination of the
two access rights. I'd be happy to draft some)
