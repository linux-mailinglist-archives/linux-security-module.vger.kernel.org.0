You said that you want to use fexit without touching security/, which
AFAIU means that the branch from security_*() to the BPF LSM will be
invisible in the *kernel's* source code unless the reader already
knows about the BPF LSM. But maybe I'm just misunderstanding your
idea.

If a random developer is trying to change the locking rules around
security_blah(), and wants to e.g. figure out whether it's okay to
call that thing with a spinlock held, or whether one of the arguments
is actually used, or stuff like that, the obvious way to verify that
is to follow all the direct and indirect calls made from
security_blah(). It's tedious, but it works, unless something is
hooked up to it in a way that is visible in no way in the source code.

I agree that the way in which the call happens behind the scenes
doesn't matter all that much - I don't really care all that much
whether it's an indirect call, a runtime-patched direct call in inline
assembly, or an fexit hook. What I do care about is that someone
reading through any affected function can immediately see that the
branch exists - in other words, ideally, I'd like it to be something
happening in the method body, but if you think that's unacceptable, I
think there should at least be a function attribute that makes it very
clear what's going on.
