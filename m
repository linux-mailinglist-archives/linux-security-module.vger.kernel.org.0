This is an important point, but there's also "can't use any lockdown 
features because the admin might need to use kprobes".  I mention a 
use-case below.

I think it's fine (and probably preferred) to keep the default behavior 
tri-state and allow LSMs to implement finer-grained policies.

Some environments _need_ a "break glass" option, and a well-defined policy
(e.g. an SELinux domain which can only be entered via serial console, with
2FA or JIT credentials) to selectively un-lock the kernel lockdown in  
production would mean the difference between having a fleet of millions of
nodes 99.999% locked down vs 0%.

Right.

Can we identify any such cases in the current patchset?

One option would be for the LSM to assign a default (untrusted/unknown) 
value for the subject and then apply policy as needed (e.g. allow or deny 
these).

Perhaps security_kernel_unlock_*
