The main purpose of the change is to addres kernel memory pressure. 
Two designs are being discussed: Sush's "snapshotting" design and
Amir's original suggestion of continously exporting the measurement
records to a tmpfs or regular file.  Both designs require verifying the
initial attestation quote by walking the entire measurement list,
calculating the expected TPM PCR value(s).  That doesn't change.
