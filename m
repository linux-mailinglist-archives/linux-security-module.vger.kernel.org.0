No need to add this line, It's part of the maintainer job. ;)

Some of my suggestions are about style, so feel free to ignore them if 
you think the original is better. Anyway, I'm not a native english 
speaker either, so there are good chances I'm not correct on some 
suggestions. What about that?:

This is the only access right implicitly handled by any ruleset, even if 
this right is not specified at ruleset creation time. Reparenting files 
will then always be denied by default. Given that 
%LANDLOCK_ACCESS_FS_REFER is available since the second Landlock ABI 
version, using the first Landlock ABI version will always forbid file 
reparenting.

For these kind of link or rename actions to be possible, one or two 
rules must explicitly allow %LANDLOCK_ACCESS_FS_REFER on the source and 
the destination hierarchies. In addition, the following constraints must 
be met:
