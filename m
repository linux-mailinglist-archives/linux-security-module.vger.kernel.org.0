Another data point: I had the TIS driver working on IRQ 5 (festeoi) 
without the introduction of this loop. There are additional bits being 
set while the interrupt handler is running, but the handler deals with 
them in the next invocation. On IRQ 13 (edge), it does need the loop 
since the next interrupt handler invocation is not happening. That IRQ 
13 is an edge interrupt, is this a hard-configured PC 'thing'? Windows 
drove this to IRQ 13, which seemed to be the only one accepted by it and 
iirc it wouldn't even touch the TIS (found via tracing) if another IRQ 
than 13 was declared in the ACPI table.
