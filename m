The current status is that all tests should pass with a minimal kernel 
configuration (cf. the test config file). Yama is an exception for these 
tests, not the norm, so you also need to test against a kernel without Yama.

They should check for the different values of ptrace_scope: 
https://docs.kernel.org/admin-guide/LSM/Yama.html
- is_yama_restricting() should return true if ptrace_scope == 1
- is_yama_denying() should return true if ptrace_scope >= 2

Restricted ptrace only forbids a child process to ptrace its parents. 
There is no specific restriction for a parent to ptrace its children.

Ptracing is always denied if ptrace_scope >= 2 (without specific 
capabilties, which is the case for these tests).

These are all the overlayfs tests but I don't know why they are failing 
with Yama. Could you please pinpoint the exact(s) failing ASSERT? 
(Whatever my following comments, this would be valuable to know the issue.)

OK, let's follow another approach.

The first alternative would be to disable Yama for all the Landlock 
ptrace tests. You'll first need to save the current Yama settings and 
restore it after each test, even if they failed. I think this 
alternative makes sense because Landlock tests should not be about Yama.

The second alternative would be to test with and without Yama, with 
different Yama settings. That would also require to disable Yama for 1/3 
or 1/4 of tests. The downside of this alternative is that it requires 3 
or 4 times variants, and it actually test Yama, which is not the goal of 
the Landlock tests.

Anyway, you also need to update the comment about Yama in the current tests.
