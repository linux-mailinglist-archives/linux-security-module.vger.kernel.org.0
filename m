I'm not sure, I'll leave that question to others.

Thanks for checking. Error injection via RTAS (pseries partition
firmware) can cause unrecoverable cache and memory corruption. Right now
I don't think including LOCKDOWN_RTAS_ERROR_INJECTION in a relaxed
integrity mode for fuzzing would yield useful results.

So I understand the proposal to involve something like:

--- a/include/linux/security.h
+++ b/include/linux/security.h
@@ -120,11 +120,12 @@ enum lockdown_reason {
 	LOCKDOWN_TIOCSSERIAL,
 	LOCKDOWN_MODULE_PARAMETERS,
 	LOCKDOWN_MMIOTRACE,
-	LOCKDOWN_DEBUGFS,
 	LOCKDOWN_XMON_WR,
 	LOCKDOWN_BPF_WRITE_USER,
 	LOCKDOWN_DBG_WRITE_KERNEL,
 	LOCKDOWN_RTAS_ERROR_INJECTION,
+	LOCKDOWN_INTEGRITY_FUZZING_MAX,
+	LOCKDOWN_DEBUGFS,
 	LOCKDOWN_INTEGRITY_MAX,
 	LOCKDOWN_KCORE,
 	LOCKDOWN_KPROBES,

Is that right?

I don't have a specific example at hand, but I suspect that enabling all
of debugfs would allow syzbot to reach code that integrity mode
ordinarily would prevent. Which doesn't seem like what you would want?

I wonder if the debugfs-hosted facilities needed by syzbot could be
identified in a finer-grained way that could be incorporated into the
lockdown reason list for this purpose. So that way only the things
syzbot needs would be exposed.
