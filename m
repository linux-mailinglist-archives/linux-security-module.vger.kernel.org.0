Not that I know of. But I'm not sure if the bootconfig the way it works
today does the trick.

For one the bootconfig is simply glued to the end of the initrd. But
that makes it part of the UKI as well. So there is no added gain.

Plus, adding the cmdline to the UKI was done on purpose to prevent any
unauthorized editing. That basically means that any change to the
cmdline needs to be signed as well. But I don't see any signature
verification while processing the bootconfig. 

Finally the bootconfig is setup too late in the boot process,
in particular after setup_arch which reserves the crashkernel
memory and needs to parse the kernel command line for that. An even more
extreme example is the decompressor phase on s390. There the command
line is parsed as well. And that is code that runs before start_kernel.

All in all I don't believe that using the bootconfig adds much benefit
for the UKI.

Thanks
Philipp
