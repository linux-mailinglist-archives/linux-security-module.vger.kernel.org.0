What I imagine with "loadable LSMs" is "trivial LSMs which do not depend
on blobs managed by infrastructure but do depend on hooks being called
by infrastructure". Some of such LSMs could be implemented using BPF, but
BPF is too limited to re-implement TOMOYO (or TOMOYO-like LSMs).

TOMOYO is one of trivial LSMs which can easily opt out from "infrastructure
managed blobs". Also, I don't have a plan to allow "loadable LSMs" to use
"infrastructure managed blobs" including "struct lsm_prop".

The "we don't care" response is really irritating. But if loadable LSMs were
banned, LSM will be dead and an alternative to LSM will be crazily pushed.
No one can enforce "military level security" to averaged Linux users.
That attempt is a reoccurrence of "Only my version is correct" crap.

Only those who needs "military level security" in LSM will use LSM.
Those who don't need "military level security" will use a different framework.

If loadable LSMs were banned, the value of distribution kernel will be
significantly lost. The point of loadable kernel module is to share the
workload.
