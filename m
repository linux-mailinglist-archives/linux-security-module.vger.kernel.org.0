Yes, it's best avoided.

The kernel keyring keys?  Not really relevant here I don't think.

"We've never had to think about having general rules on what security
modules do before..."

We famously haven't imposed restrictions on the label format before
now, and this seems like a pretty poor reason to start.

Both the multiplexed and subj_X proposals handle the single major LSM
case the same: identical to what we have now.  Regardless of how
important the single major LSM case may be, it isn't a distinguishing
factor in this discussion.

Finding subj_X in an audit record is no different than finding any
other field in a record.  Parsing the multiplexed label mess is a
whole different problem and prone to lots of mistakes.

I didn't want to have to NAK this, but if that is what it is going to
take, so be it ... as it currently stands I'm NAK'ing the the
multiplexed approach.  You don't have to go with the subj_X approach,
but the multiplexed approach is a terrible idea and I can almost
guarantee that we would be regretting that choice in a few years time.
