Trust is not binary, though. "Do I trust this application to perform
this specific action" is different from "do I trust this application to
perform any action in the future". A security mechanism should grant the
minimum required privileges required to perform the operation; this
token thing encourages (defaults to) broader grants, which is worrysome.

If the use case is to punch holes in the user namespace isolation I feel
like that is better solved at the user namespace level than the BPF
subsystem level...
