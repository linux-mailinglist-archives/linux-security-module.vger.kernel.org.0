Generally speaking, I’d say trusting the CAAM RNG and trusting in it’s
other features are two separate things. However, reading through the CAAM
key blob spec I’ve got here, CAAM key blob keys (the keys that secure a blob’s
content) are generated using its internal RNG. So I’d save if the CAAM RNG
is insecure, so are generated key blobs. Maybe somebody with more insight
into the CAAM internals can verify that, but I don’t see any point in using
the kernel’s RNG as long as we let CAAM generate the key blob keys for us.

Cheers,
dave
