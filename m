When we moved stuff around for stacking, we moved other allocation
duties into the "core" of the LSM, so it just seemed reasonable to me to
do it again if this happened.

Yeah, agreed. Since allocations would need to swap kmalloc() for
kmem_bucket_alloc(), we could also create something like lsm_alloc() and
hide everything from the individual LSMs -- the core would handle
allocating and using the buckets handle, etc.

Does anyone want to make a series for this? I am not planning to -- I'm
focused on the per-site implementation.

I haven't had a chance to refresh the patch series, but the implementation
still works well. Besides some smaller feedback, I had also wanted to
make the individual buckets be allocated as needed. That way if something
was only doing allocations in, say, the 16 to 128 byte range, we wouldn't
lose memory to track the (unused) higher order bucket sizes.

I expect to send out the next revision after the coming merge window.
