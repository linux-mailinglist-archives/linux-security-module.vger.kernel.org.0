O, selinux=3D0 is the proper way to disable SELinux if necessary.  I believ=
e there is an open bugzilla on Fedora related to this issue, since runtime =
disable was originally introduced for Fedora.

On my way to lunch I came up with another relatively simple solution
that should address this problem at the infrastructure level. Let me
try to write it up into a patch, hopefully it will work...
