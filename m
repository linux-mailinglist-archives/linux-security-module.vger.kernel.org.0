Yes, with the sandboxer use case.  It's similar to a container that
doesn't know all programs that could be run in it.  We should be able to
create sandboxes that don't assume (nor restrict) internal IPCs (or any
kind of direct process I/O).

Landlock should make it possible to scope any kind of IPC.  It's a
mental model which is easy to understand and that should be enforced by
default.  Of course, we need some ways to add exceptions to this
deny-by-default policy, and that's why we also need the FS-based control
mechanism.

Both approaches are complementary/orthogonal and make sense long term
too.  This might be the first time we can restrict the same operations,
but I'm pretty sure it will not be the last, and it's OK.  Handled FS
access and scoped restrictions are two ways to describe a part of the
security policy.  Having different ways makes the interface much simpler
than a generic one that would have to take into account all potential
future access controls.

One thing to keep in mind is that UAPI doesn't have to map 1:1 to the
kernel implementation, but the UAPI is stable and future proof, whereas
the kernel implementation can change a lot.

The ruleset's handled fields serve two purposes: define what should be
denied by default, and define which type of rules are valid
(compatibility).  The ruleset's scoped field serve similar purposes but
it also implies implicit rules (i.e. communications with processes
inside the sandbox are allowed).  Without the soped field, we would have
to create dedicated handled field per type (i.e. scope's bit) and
dedicated rule type for the related handled field, which would make the
interface more generic but also more complex, for something which is not
needed.

In a nutshell, in the case of the FS-based and scope-based unix socket
control, we should see one kind of restrictions (e.g. connect to unix
socket), which can accept two types of rules: (explicit) file path, or
(implicit) peer's scope.  Access should be granted as long as a rule
matches, whatever its type.

This rationale should be explained in a commit message.

I'm not sure to understand, but I hope my explanation above will answer
this question.

Yes, restricting a sandbox too much may not work for any possible use
cases.  Some use cases would need the FS-based control before using the
scope-based one, and that's OK.  Some use cases would not need the
FS-based control, and the scope-based one would be enough (e.g.
sandboxed archive manager).

Nothing in Landlock is on by default for compatibility reasons.

Scoped-based control should be enforced in most cases, but FS-based
control might be a requirement/dependency.  In any case, a sandbox
should not break legitimate use cases.

I would say a *fully* sandboxed program for a desktop use case using X11
(instead of Wayland), which is not possible with Landlock *alone* yet.
Desktop environment is the worse case scenario for sandboxing, for a lot
of different reasons... but there are a lot of other use cases for
sandboxing.

Receiving criticisms is part of the review process, which is a sign of
healthy development.  I understand your concerns and it's good discuss
about them to make sure we are going in the right direction.

In any case, if someone doesn't understand something, it probably means
that this should be explained better somewhere.  Such design artifacts
will be useful for future developments too.
