Hi Nicolai

thanks a lot for the patches. Still didn't go through them, but if I
understood correctly you assume that the SHA1 PCR bank would be still
seen by IMA.

In light of deprecation of SHA1, is this assumption correct?

I would expect that TPM manufacturers or even the TPM driver would
change to fullfill that.

I guess the first stage would be making sure that the SHA1 PCR bank is
unusable at the TPM driver level. A first thought would be to extend
the SHA1 PCR bank with a random value at boot (or earlier), so that the
remote attestation would never work on that PCR bank. At that point, I
would probably go further and not expose the SHA1 PCR bank at all, so
you would have less problems on IMA side.

The second stage would probably be that the TPM firmware would be
updated, not allowing the SHA1 PCR bank to be allocated.

Other than that, sure, also actions need to be done to remove SHA1
support in IMA (will look at your patches).

Roberto
