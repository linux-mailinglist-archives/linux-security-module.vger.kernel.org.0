Reason the lock is taken even in the case the key is not queued is to 
avoid the following race condition:

  => ima_init() sets ima_initialized flag and calls the dequeue function

  => If IMA hook checks ima_initialized flag outside the lock and sees 
the flag is not set, it will call the queue function.

  => If the above two steps race, the key could get added to the queue 
after ima_init() has processed the queued keys.

That's the reason I named the function called by the IMA hook to 
ima_queue_or_process_key_for_measurement().

But I can make the following change:

  => IMA hook checks the flag.
  => If it is set, process key immediately
  => If the flag is not set, call ima_queue_or_process_key_for_measurement()

ima_queue_or_process_key_for_measurement() will do the following:

  => With the lock held check ima_initialized flag
  => If true release the lock and call process_buffer_measurement()
  => If false, queue the key and then release the lock

Would that be acceptable?

Just wanted to confirm:
Rename ima_post_key_create_or_update() to a more appropriate name?

Another reason for doing all key related operations in 
ima_queue_or_process_key_for_measurement() is to isolate key related 
code in a separate C file and build it if and only if the CONFIG 
dependencies are met.

With respect to loading custom policy, I will take a look at how to 
handle that case. Thanks for pointing that out.
