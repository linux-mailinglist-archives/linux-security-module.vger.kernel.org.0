Thanks Guenter, it looks like KP already make up a branch for you to
pull, but if you have any problems or need something different let us
know.

In this particular case we are most interested in testing the LSM
initializing code so I don't believe you need to worry much about
LSM/BPF configuration, it's a matter of ensuring the different arches
are able to boot without any panics/warnings/etc.

There is some Kconfig needed, KP provided a good snippet earlier in
this thread, the relevant portion is copied below:

% cat .config | grep -i LOCKDOWN
CONFIG_SECURITY_LOCKDOWN_LSM=3Dy
CONFIG_SECURITY_LOCKDOWN_LSM_EARLY=3Dy
CONFIG_LSM=3D"landlock,lockdown,yama,loadpin,safesetid,bpf"

... and here is the full message:
