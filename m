I was referring to the full description:

config SYSTEM_BLACKLIST_HASH_LIST
	string "Hashes to be preloaded into the system blacklist keyring"
	depends on SYSTEM_BLACKLIST_KEYRING
	help
	  If set, this option should be the filename of a list of hashes in the
	  form "<hash>", "<hash>", ... .  This will be included into a C
	  wrapper to incorporate the list into the kernel.  Each <hash> should
	  be a string of hex digits.

…but the short description doesn't mention filename.
