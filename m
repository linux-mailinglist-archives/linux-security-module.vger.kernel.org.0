Hello Tingmao,

Thank you for sending this.

I've read the proposal and had some time to gather thoughts on it. I'm
planning to break this feedback into multiple parts.

This first part addresses the intersect flag.

Instead of intersection being done at the rule level via
landlock_add_rule, would it be better for intersection to be done at the
ruleset_fd/ruleset level?

So instead of intersecting individual rules, you can intersect entire
rulesets, with the added benefit of being able to intersect handled
accesses as well. (so you could handle an access initially, and not
handle it later).

Intersecting at the ruleset level allows for grouping the intersection rules
together, so you could create an unenforced ruleset for the sole purpose
of intersecting with rulesets, and intersect all the rule(s) at once.

That way, the ruleset fd can be reused for this purpose later with other
supervisees, instead of creating ruleset, intersecting individual rules,
repeat.

I think also the semantics of having a function called
"landlock_add_rule" actually removing accesses (when the intersect flag
is added) is also confusing, because we're not really *add*-ing
anything, we're removing.

ALTERNATIVE #1

Maybe the best way to do it is instead continue treating rulesets as
immutable, but allow composition of them at ruleset creation time.

This would look something like:

Ruleset C = Ruleset A & Ruleset B

Ruleset A and B are never modified, but instead a new Ruleset C is
created that is the intersection of A and B. This could be done in a
variety of ways (LANDLOCK_CREATE_RULESET_INTERSECT? new IOCTL?)

An example API for what this might look like:

  struct landlock_ruleset_attr ruleset_attr = {
          // other fields for handled accesses must be blank.
          .left_fd = existing_fd,
          .right_fd = other_existing_fd,
  };
  int new_ruleset_fd = syscall(SYS_landlock_create_ruleset, &ruleset_attr, 
    sizeof(ruleset_attr), LANDLOCK_CREATE_RULESET_INTERSECT);

And then the resulting ruleset which is the intersection of existing_fd
and other_existing_fd could be returned.

Similarly, we could: 

  int new_ruleset_fd = syscall(SYS_landlock_create_ruleset, &ruleset_attr, 
      sizeof(ruleset_attr), LANDLOCK_CREATE_RULESET_UNION);

Which would be convienent for creating unions of rulesets.

Then instead mutating rulesets, we commit/replace an entirely new ruleset.

ioctl(supervisee_fd, LANDLOCK_IOCTL_COMMIT_RULESET, &new_ruleset_fd);

This has the following benefits:

1. Clearer semantics: "landlock_add_rule" is just for adding rules, not
removing.

2. Intersection of all ruleset attributes, not just individual rule
attributes.

3. Better logical grouping of rules for the purpose of intersection, and
better composition.

It does have drawbacks:

1. Intersecting individual rules requires making an entire ruleset for
that one rule.

2. Users must be responsible for closing the unused/old rulesets that
they might not longer need.

ALTERNATIVE #2

A middle ground is to keep the ruleset mutation via landlock_add_rule,
but have it be done at the ruleset_fd level.

Something like this:

  struct landlock_ruleset_operand intersection = {
    .operand = other_ruleset_fd
  };
  landlock_add_rule(ruleset_fd, LANDLOCK_RULE_INTERSECT_RULESET, &intersection, 0))

I think this is also a valid way to do things, and increases the
reusibility of rulesets.

1. Again, having landlock_add_rule being used to actually remove rules
is confusing.

2. I'm unsure if we can change handled accesses after ruleset creation,
so we might not be able to intersect the handled accesses like we can in
the ALTERNATIVE #1.

At a minimum, it is cumbersome, and I worry about file descriptors
becoming inaccessible (due to bind mounts / namespace changes in the
supervisor's environment).

Of course they can just hold those file descriptors open for the purposes
of future intersections, but this is annoying and error prone.
