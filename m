These IOCTLs may be only used by the fscrypt tool on most distros but
there are of course no guarantee any application could use it to encrypt
its own files according to various use cases.

Correct

My point was to highlight that nodev IOCTLs might be used by user space
on regular files and directories, not only /dev files, and we should be
careful to not inadvertently deny legitimate IOCTLs.  I think
nodev-IOCTLs are legitimate for unprivileged users, taking into account
capability checks and file mode checks, which might not be the case for
IOCTLs implemented by drivers.

You can take a look ad do_vfs_ioctl() to get a hint about other
FS-related IOCTLs (i.e. FIGETBSZ, FIONREAD), and all other nodev-files
(e.g. pipe, sockets) IOCTLs that may be required to properly use them.

We should be careful to find the good balance between restricting as
much as possible but without breaking user space and bother users that
would then disable security features. ;)

We're now going withouth the split, but this nodev property could in fact
be part of step 2 (or 3).  Indeed, being able to differenciate file type
would enable to enforce a nodev-like control over a file hierarchy.
