I already gave feedback:

It is probably inevitable that this be added, but you need to document it
properly and not make misleading claims like "The key material is generated
within the kernel" (for the TPM "trust" source the default is to use the TPM's
RNG, *not* the kernel RNG), and "is never disclosed to userspace in clear text"
(that's only guaranteed to be true for non-malicious userspace).  Also please
properly document that this is mainly intended for accessing key wrapping
hardware such as CAAM that can't be accessed from userspace in another way like
TPMs can.
