I see that Paul Moore has also replied and indicated that 'stacking'
doesn't imply either/or separation of security policy in a string of
LSM's.  As he also noted, it does not apply isolation and application
of security policy at the container or kernel resource namespace
level.

Just as an FYI, we will be releasing version 2 of our Trusted Security
Event Modeling (TSEM) LSM over the weekend for review and inclusion in
the upstream kernel.

TSEM 'stacks' with the other LSM's, but was architected from the
ground up to support the notion of security namespaces that operate
exclusively from one another, with the express goal of allowing
multiple and distinct security policies to be applied independently at
what would be considered the 'container' level.  Subordinate security
modeling namespaces also act independently from the security
model/policy that the 'root' modeling namespace is operating under.

TSEM is based on a mathematical modeling architecture that is
different from either the label or pathname based LSM's which allowed
us to sidestep some of the issues that are challenging with respect to
implementing full namespace support for those LSM's.

There is a sizable stack of documentation with TSEM that goes further
into all of this.  We also release a rather significant body of
userspace tooling that goes with the TSEM LSM to support running
'security containers', for lack of a better term.

It obviously takes a while to develop a security eco-system but TSEM
will hopefully offer security architects additional flexibility moving
forward.
