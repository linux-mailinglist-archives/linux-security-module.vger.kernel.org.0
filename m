I'm not for or against this or a similar patch. The information Tetsuo is=
=20
looking for cannot be recreated from logs. What if it were a daemon that's=
=20
been running for a year? With the amount of data you are suggesting to log,=
=20
it would have rotated away months ago. To log all of the system calls you=
=20
mention would be abusive of the audit system, hurt performance, wear out SS=
D=20
drives, and ultimately fail.

There may be other reasons you don't like the patch and that's fine. But=20
saying it can be done from user space after the fact is not helpful.

-Steve
