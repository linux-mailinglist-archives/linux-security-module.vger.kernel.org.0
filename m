FWIW, I wasn't expecting to see your sign-off without a note that you
had merged it.  Normally I would have expected either an acked-by or a
note that you had merged it, a sign-off without a merge notice seemed
a little odd to me so I thought I would mention the above :)  No harm
either way, I just figured a little discussion on process might not be
a terrible idea to make sure we are all on the same page.

I generally don't do topic branches for work that has been merged into
a -next or -stable branch. I prefer to limit topic branches to
special-cases where there is some value in keeping a central branch
for multiple people to coordinate while the patchset is still in
development; once a patchset has progressed far enough to be merged
into a -stable or -next branch I stop maintaining the topic branch.

In this particular case the changes to the IMA/EVM code looked very
minor, so I doubt there would be a significant merge conflict with the
IMA/EVM tree during this development cycle, but if you would prefer to
take this patchset via the IMA/EVM tree that is okay with me; just let
me know so I can ACK the two LSM-related patches (I'm going to review
the latest posting today).

As a bit of an aside, while this doesn't cover topic branches (once
again, I consider those special cases), when managing the LSM tree I
follow the process that is documented here:

https://github.com/LinuxSecurityModule/kernel/blob/main/README.md

[NOTE: the above GH repo is a read-only mirror of the canonical LSM
kernel.org repo, it just happens that GH does a better job rendering
txt]

The main LSM repo process "docs" / pointers can be found in the main
README or "about" page:

https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/pcmoore/lsm.git/about

If people have suggestions for a different approach to managing the
LSM tree I'm always open to discussion.
