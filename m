Perhaps you are misunderstanding me... I don't have a problem with BPF
LSM registering callbacks for all the hooks. My point is about what
you can trigger once you attach programs to certain hooks. All the
above seem to be just optimizations/implementation details that do not
affect the problem I'm pointing to.

The point is that for this particular hook (secid_to_secctx) and a
couple others, the consequences of having control over the return
value are more serious than with other hooks. For most hooks, the
implementation usually just returns 0 (OK), -EACCESS (access denied)
or -E... (error) and the caller either continues as normal or handles
the error. But here if you return 0, you signal that you have
initialized the pointer and size to valid values. So suddenly the BPF
prog doesn't just control allow/deny decisions, but can now easily
trigger kernel panic. And when you look at the semantics of the hook,
you will realize that it doesn't really make sense to implement it via
BPF, since it can never populate the output values and the only
meaningful implementation would be to just return -EOPNOTSUPP.

Maybe I have it all wrong, but isn't the whole point of BPF programs
to provide a tight sandbox where you can only implement pure input ->
output functions + read/modify some internal state? Is it really
"working as intended" if you can crash the kernel by attaching a
simple BPF program to a certain hook? I mean yes, you can make the
system pretty much unusable already using the classic hooks by simply
returning -EACCESS for everything, but IMO that's quite different from
causing the kernel to do an invalid memory access.
