AFAICT, this bug doesn't only affect eCryptfs. It also affects Intel
nvdimm support starting with:

 commit 4c6926a23b76ea23403976290cd45a7a143f6500
 Author: Dave Jiang <dave.jiang@intel.com>
 Date:   Thu Dec 6 12:40:01 2018 -0800

     acpi/nfit, libnvdimm: Add unlock of nvdimm support for Intel DIMMs

So without a workaround in trusted.ko, encrypted_key support will need
to be removed from eCryptfs and nvdimm to address this issue.
