Having a single keyring with keys from multiple software vendors is the sta=

Since you didn't agree with my example of "usage oriented keyrings", please
provide an example.

Without a concrete example of "usage oriented keyrings", it's hard to under=
stand
why "additional" granularity should be deferred.  From my perspective,
"additional" granularity is the main issue.
