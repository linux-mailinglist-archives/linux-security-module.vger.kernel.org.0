Hi!

thanks for looking into this.

Yes, this is the case. Besides, before instrumenting, we would need some
way to find those syscalls in the highly obfuscated dynamically
generated code, the whole purpose of which is to prevent disassembling,
debugging and finding things like that in it.

Ultimately, even for the cases when it would be technically feasible I
don't think Wine could ever go for modifying the program's code (unless
of course this is the part of what the program is doing itself using
winapi calls). Wine is trying to implement the API as close to Windows
as possible so the DRM can work with Wine, modifying the program's code
is something different.

Yes, exactly. Pretty much any memory allocation which Wine does needs
syscalls (if those are ever encountered later during executing code from
those areas) to be trapped by Wine and passed to Wine's implementation
of the corresponding Windows API function. Linux native libraries
loading and memory allocations performed by them go outside of Wine contr=

We are not much concerned with the overhead of the trapped syscall in
our use case, those are very rare. What we are concerned with is the
performance impact on the normal Linux syscalls when the syscall
trapping is enabled. When I was measuring that impact I've got the same
10% overhead for the untrapped syscalls (that is, always hitting
SECCOMP_RET_ALLOW case) with the filters Gabriel mentioned.

I am afraid that for a general case the filter add / update / removal
should be done not just when a new library is loaded or unloaded but
pretty much any time new (executable) memory region is allocated or
deallocated, or PROT_EXEC should be changed on allocated pages . But I
am not sure I've got enough details yet on the suggested approach here
and might be missing important details. I guess maybe we could discuss
the details separately with Gabriel first.
