At the risk of asking a newbie question, why is this access right
prefixed with % in this command, but most others are surrounded by
double-backticks in other places?

According to [1], % is used to denote a constant - should these
LANDLOCK_ACCESS_FS* rights not all be showing up as constants?

Apart from this item, this change looks good.
