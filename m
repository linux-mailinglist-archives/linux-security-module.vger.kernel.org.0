Neither of you actually answered my question, which is whether the support for
trusted keys in dm-crypt is a mistake.  I think you're saying that it is?  That
would imply that fscrypt shouldn't support trusted keys, but rather encrypted
keys -- which conflicts with Ahmad's patch which is adding support for trusted
keys.  Note that your reasoning for this is not documented at all in the
trusted-encrypted keys documentation; it needs to be (email threads don't really
matter), otherwise how would anyone know when/how to use this feature?
