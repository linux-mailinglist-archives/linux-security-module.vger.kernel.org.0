If I understand you correctly this is what I started to do since the beginning of the year with CVEHound project.
https://github.com/evdenis/cvehound/

Kconfig analysis available with --config option.

I take info about fixed CVEs from MITRE, NIST NVD and other sources (RedHat, Ubuntu, linuxkernelcves, ...).
Vulnerable version info in the databases is not reliable. Most of the time I need to figure out the bug commit
and event double check the "Fixes:" tag.

> The script then attempts to patch the source code to determine which vulnerabilities are still present in the codebase.

Just application of a patch with -R option will not work in case the code is modified since the fix and in case of backports.
I describe CVEs with coccinelle patterns. https://coccinelle.gitlabpages.inria.fr/website/
Coccinelle is already broadly used in kernel (see scripts/coccinelle).

> The end goal is to help the user understand the state of the active codebase, whereas most tools stop at the kernel version, and then the activity is all manual.

Exactly. CodeBase+KernelConfig.
Many vendors (e.g. samsung) don't update kernel version info, they just backport fixes.

As for now, I described > 200 kernel CVEs with coccinelle patterns.
Usually it takes me exactly 10-15 minutes to write a pattern (without testing it).
I test a pattern to detect a missing fix since the commit the bug was introduced.
https://github.com/evdenis/cvehound/blob/master/tests/test_05_between_fixes_fix.py

I don't rely on kernel version at all. Usually a pattern contains information about
bug conditions or/and about missing fix.

I already found some trophies with it like missing backports:
  https://lkml.org/lkml/2021/1/21/1278
or partial backports:
  https://github.com/oracle/linux-uek/commit/ee7ab9e8f9cb844c4fac8ca9bcc1a0f3f8fdc9bb
  vs
  https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git/commit/drivers/block/rbd.c?h=linux-4.4.y&id=e349a5786f4c23eb11d1e7385703ddbf94f3f061
