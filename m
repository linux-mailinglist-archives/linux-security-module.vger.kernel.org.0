All the end user needs to do is compress any module created by the group =
that built
the original kernel image to work around the scenario above.  Then the =
appended=20
signature in the compressed module will be verified by the kernel =
keyring. Does=20
this mean there is a security problem that should be fixed, if this is a =
concern?

For the use case above, wouldn=E2=80=99t it be better to use a module =
policy like:

appraise func=3DMODULE_CHECK appraise_type=3Dimasig

Obviously the downside is it disables appended signatures. It would =
prevent=20
compressed modules from loading, and only allow ima signed modules to =
load.
