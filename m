ABI stability is about the most important thing to Linus, so yes, if
documentation and code disagree, then we should fix the documentation,
except in the case where the current behavior just really is wrong
or insecure.

Here's my current reading:

The bprm->cred is initially set from current's, with suid and fsuid set
to euid.  So new->euid will be same as old->euid.  Then
bprm_creds_from_file() will call bprm_fill_uid() right before
security_bprm_creds_from_file().  bprm_fill_uid() will set new->euid to
the file's i_uid - only if the setuid bit is set AND only if not
task_no_new_privs(current).  Meaning that for NNP tasks it never sets
new->euid to the file's i_uid.

I think the summary is that I don't object to your patch per se (except
the ambient creds part, which I'll reply to later - oh and possibly the
potential for capability dropping, also for later), but your
terminology.  setuid and setgid mean something very specific: a file
which, when any user executes it, causes execution to happen under the
file's owner credentials.  And the behavior you are changing has nothing
to do with that.  What you are changing is that a NNP process with
different ruid and euid will continue to run, after exec, with those
previous ruid and euid, whether or not the file is setXid.

I meant I hadn't yet delved back into the location of bprm_fill_uid()
etc, and I know that code has moved around a bit in the last few years.
