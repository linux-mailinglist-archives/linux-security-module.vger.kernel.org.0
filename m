Sigh....

It would thus appear that effective dialogue in the Linux kernel
community is now about as perilous as attempting to square dance in a
minefield with snowshoes on.

When we penned the reflections above, we very specifically did not
want to be so pejorative as to suggest that anyone involved in this
endeavor wouldn't have at least a basic understanding of the
computability theory that all of our work is based.  They even have a
movie about it, presumably in multiple languages.

In any event, we apologize for being mistaken.

We will add a Wikipedia link in the documentation pointing to an
article on Turing machines, for the benefit of the unwashed masses now
involved in kernel development.

I believe you are referring to Fermat's Last Theorem, formerly known
as Fermat's Conjecture.

For all the bystanders whose level of understanding is limited to
'make bzImage':

Fermat's Conjecture, now a proven and foundational theorem in
algebraic number theory, states that there exist no three positive
integers: a, b or c; that satisfies the following algebraic
relationship for any value of n greater than two:

a^n + b^n = c^n

Fermat penned the theorem into the margin of his copy of Diophantus's
Arithmetica, and in a note below it, indicated there was insufficient
room in the margin to write the formal proof.

It was called Fermat's Conjecture, since many doubted its validity or
that Fermat ever had any proof for what he was proposing.

As a Quixote team we take some solace to your reference of Fermat's
Theorem with respect to our work.  It took 358 years to formally prove
his theorem, in the face of many nay-sayers.  It turns out he was
absolutely right and his vision is now universally accepted as a
foundational premise of mathematics.

And so it goes with respect to the perils of innovation.

Yes, and I need to get outside and get my fishhouse off the lake.  It
is going to be -20 tonight and the 4-wheeler isn't going to start in
the morning.

We always appreciate the insight that you bring forward with respect
to our work.

Best wishes for a pleasant weekend.

As always,
