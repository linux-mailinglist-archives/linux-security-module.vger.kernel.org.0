Yup. Agreed.

I had this question about the usability of AK/EK in this
context. Although AK/EK + PCR quote is needed to verify the snapshot
shards / IMA logs are not tampered with, I am still not sure why AK/EK
needs to be part of the shard/IMA log. The client sending AK/EK to
attestation service separately would still serve the purpose, right?

For instance, PCR quotes will be signed by AK. So as long as the verifier
trusts the AK/EK, it can verify the quotes are not tampered with.
Replaying IMA log/snapshot can produce the PCR quotes which can be
matched with signed PCR quotes. If they match, then the verifier can
conclude that the IMA log is not tampered with. So AK doesn't need to
be part of the log/snapshot.

BTW, in this proposal, kernel is truncating the log and passing the
truncated buffer to UM.  UM client need to save it to the disk location
of it's choice.

Agreed. You don’t have to go all the way to the boot snapshot
(shard).  It is up to the attestation service which last-known-good PCR
quotes (sometimes referred as golden PCR quotes) it trusts, and verify
the snapshots / logs after that.
