No we didn't.

I've managed engineers before, I've never found a successful strategy
to be:

"Go off and do what I told you to do".

Without some kind of explanation and dialogue.

The Linux community has a process problem with the LSM and the
security sub-system that needs to be addressed.  Personally, I now
have the cycles to address it.

We assume that if Timur elects to port the Apple security API (Timur's
ESF implementation) into the kernel, he will face the same issue that
concerns us.

When Paul Moore came on-board three years ago as the security
maintainer, he was immediately VERY prescriptive with respect to
establishing policies and guidelines that he wanted followed for LSM
submissions.

We see that he sent those guidelines to Timur in case he was
interested in submitting ESF as a new LSM.  Here is the link for those
who haven't seen it.

https://github.com/LinuxSecurityModule/kernel/blob/main/README.md#new-lsms

What those guidelines are missing are prescriptive practices for
bringing a major body of virgin code into the security review process.
As we did with TSEM, and presumably Timur will have to do with ESF, if
he moves forward with that initiative.

For the benefit of those following this conversation and to close the
record in this thread from our perspective, as tedious as that might
be.

From an architectural perspective, TSEM consists of a series of
compilation units, each dedicated to a specific functional role needed
to support the LSM.  We used a single include file that holds all of
the enumerations and structure definitions that are referenced by
every compilation unit.

We chose a submssion model of introducing this include file as a
single patch in the series, after a complete sub-system documentation
patch.  Introduction of virgin sub-systems isn't really common but this
strategy was consistent with what we had previously observed.

In addition, we believe that Knuth was quoted at one time about an
understanding of a program flows from an understanding of its data
structures.

You reviewed about half of one compilation unit and said you didn't
have time for anymore.  For the record, we made the changes that you
requested and responded to your other concerns for that unit.

Your primary issue, which you have repeated often, as you did here,
was with the fact that we had a single header file in the patch series
with all of the LSM global definitions.  You indicated that the patch
series should be broken up in order to 'tell a story' by including the
structure and enumeration definitions with the code.

Fair enough, you are a valued voice in the Linux security community,
but your right pinky finger is not on the RETURN key that sends
security sub-system pull requests to Linus, Paul Moore's is.

If anyone chooses to review the new LSM guidelines, they will note
that it never makes mention of the fact that a patch series should
'tell a story' and/or how that should be done.

So, before we committed a ton of development time into what could very
well end up being a tag team match to try and please two maintainers,
we reached out to Paul for advice on how he would like to see a virgin
patch series structured.

His response was that TSEM had significant issues, the least of which
was the organization of the patch series.  We repeatedly asked him to
detail what those problems were, as by his own admission he had only
read the documentation and not offered any review comments on the code
itself.

The only thing we received was that, in certain security behavior
modeling configurations enabled by TSEM, the security response would
be asynchronous from the event or events that triggered it.

We attempted to pursue further dialogue surrounding this.  The last
response, at least a year ago now, was that he didn't think he needed
to respond to us because of our 'tone'.  If anyone hasn't noticed, our
'tone' is driven by the fact that we tend to not be easily bul*ted.

So, in the interest of furthering Linux security development while at
the same time promoting homeostatic harmony in the community, we will
be sending out a request to the security list to formally address this
issue with new LSM's.

It obviously doesn't make sense to waste your or other people's time
addressing the other issues you have below, other than to agree that
we disagree on where security is headed and how Linux needs to
respond.
