It is *now* (i.e. before your proposal is accepted) that we need to discuss.

Your proposal needs to know MAX_LSM_COUNT at compile time, that's why
we need to discuss now.

That won't help at all. You became so blind because what you want to use (i.e.
SELinux and BPF) are already supported by Linux distributors. The reason I'm
insisting on supporting LKM-based LSMs is that Linux distributors cannot afford
supporting minor LSMs.

Dave Chinner said

  Downstream distros support all sorts of out of tree filesystems loaded
  via kernel modules

at https://lkml.kernel.org/r/ZQo94mCzV7hOrVkh@dread.disaster.area , and e.g.
antivirus software vendors use out of tree filesystems loaded via kernel
modules (because neither the upstream kernel community nor the Linux distributors
can afford supporting out of tree filesystems used by antivirus software vendors).

If Linux distributors decide "we don't allow loading out of tree filesystems
via kernel modules because we can't support", that's the end of the world for
such filesystems.

What I'm saying is nothing but s/filesystem/LSM/g .
If Linux distributors decide "we don't allow loading out of tree LSMs
via kernel modules because we can't support", that's the end of the world for
LKM-based LSMs.

The mechanism which makes LKM-based LSMs possible must not be disabled by
the person/organization who builds the vmlinux.

You might still say that "You can build your vmlinux and distribute it", but
that is also impossible in practice. Some device drivers are meant to be loaded
for Linux distribution's prebuilt kernels. Also, debuginfo package is needed for
analyzing vmcore. Building vmlinux and distributing it is not practical without
becoming a well-known Linux distributors enough to get out-of-tree device drivers
being prebuilt (such as Red Hat).

Again, you are so blind.

Like I demonstrated at https://lkml.kernel.org/r/cc8e16bb-5083-01da-4a77-d251a76dc8ff@I-love.SAKURA.ne.jp ,
removing CONFIG_SECURITY_HOOKS_WRITABLE does not break my hack.
