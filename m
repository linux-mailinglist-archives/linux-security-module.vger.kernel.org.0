I would argue that simply tolerating a given input and recommending
its use are two different things.  I'm not sure we're officially
recommending any particular usage, we just describe how the syscall
works and we let userspace do as they see fit within those
constraints.

As you well know, there is nothing preventing that use case.

Noted, but I disagree primarily on the grounds that this implies both
a preference for a particular use case (see above) as well as the
impossibility of understanding the intention behind all of the
userspace applications that may make use of this in the future.

Fair enough, thank you for the review and debate.

For others tuning into this thread, I believe it is important to
mention that this patch restored an API behavior that had been in
existence for several months (all?) of the original patchset's life;
the best time to suggest changes to that behavior was during those ~16
months.  If we were to change the API behavior now, we would need to
have some demonstrated harm, e.g. 32-bit/64-bit ABI incompatibility,
to consider a change.
