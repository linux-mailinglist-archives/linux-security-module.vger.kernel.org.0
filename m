Hi Kees, hi LSM community,

I'm currently struggling a bit with the bare simplicity of loadpin and tryi=
ng to understand which options exist for me.

We have the following situation:=20
Our root file system is integrity protected with dm-verity. During the deve=
lopment/validation stage, we create builds that use a test key for secure b=
oot.  For certain builds that successfully passed validation, we would like=
 to "promote" these builds to be a real release and sign them with the real=
 secure-boot/verified-boot release keys. This requires us to re-sign all se=
cure-boot signed artifacts (bootloaders, TEE, kernel, ...) including the dm=
-verity root hash(es) of the filesystem(s). During this re-signing process =
we do not want to touch the root file system (due to validation concerns) b=
ut only to provide new signatures for the dm-verity root hash.
As it turns out, some of the firmware blobs of our system are signed with t=
he secure boot keys of the system and this signature is validated somewhere=
 outside of the Linux kernel (by other firmware, by the TEE...). So, we wan=
ted to move those outside of the root filesystem in order to avoid changing=
 the file system as part of the release re-signing process. However, we the=
n noticed that the kernel driver seems to load these firmwares using the us=
ual firmware loader infrastructure of Linux. Consequently, loadpin kicks in=
, does its job and denies loading the firmware as it comes now from this ex=
tra partition.

So, I was wondering if adding an exception list to loadpin could be a reaso=
nable approach to this issue. If I understand the whole infrastructure corr=
ectly, the driver requests a firmware (file) by name. If I know on my syste=
m that the firmware with this name is self-contained secure-boot signed and=
 later-on validated independently anyways, there is no security benefit in =
letting loadpin enforce that it must come from my root fs. Consequently, I =
was thinking of adding a (configurable) exception list mechanism to loadpin=
 to accept certain firmwares (by name) even if they are not loaded from the=
 pinned fs.

Would you be open to such an extension of loadpin? If there are other sugge=
stions how this issue could be addressed, I'm also grateful for input. I wo=
uld like to see a solution that enables us to use loadpin as it saves quite=
 some effort on kernel module signing.

Best Regards,

Martin
