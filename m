The UEFI db and MOK keys are being loaded onto the .platform keyring,
which is suppose to be limited to verifying the kexec kernel image
signature.  With a downstream patch, kernel modules are being verified
as well.

Initially Patrick Uiterwijk's "[PATCH 0/3] Load keys from TPM2 NV Index
on IMA keyring" patch set attempted to define a new root of trust based
on a key stored in the TPM.  This patch set is similarly attempting to
define a new root of trust based on CA keys stored in the MOK db.

The purpose of this patch set is to define a new, safe trust source
parallel to the builtin keyring, without relying on a downstream patch.
With the new root of trust, the end user could sign his own kernel
modules, sign third party keys, and load keys onto the IMA keyring,
which can be used for signing the IMA policy and other files.

Nayna previously said,
   "I believe the underlying source from where CA keys are loaded might vary 
   based on the architecture (".mok" is UEFI specific.). The key part is 
   that this new keyring should contain only CA keys which can be later 
   used to vouch for user keys loaded onto IMA or secondary keyring at 
   runtime. It would be good to have a "ca" in the name, like .xxxx-ca, 
   where xxxx can be machine, owner, or system. I prefer .system-ca."

The CA keys on the MOK db is simply the first root of trust being
defined, but other roots of trust are sure to follow.  For this reason,
I agree naming the new keyring "mok" should be avoided.

thanks,

Mimi
