yeah I know that one all too well, I hit 40 hours some time Wednesday

honestly it worries me, but that is more a vague general worry about
any generic architecture that you can build on top of. Take BPF, it
has a whole host of issues, that make it very challenging, like
spectre gadgets, and getting its verifier correct for everything.
There is a lot of complexity there making it a challenge to evaluate.

I really need to dig into the details of TSEM before I can give a better
response.
