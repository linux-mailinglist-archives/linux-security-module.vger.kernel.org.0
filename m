So the thing is, I absolutely believe in the kernel _notifying_ about
changes so that people don't need to poll. It's why I did merge the
notification queues, although I wanted to make sure that those worked.

No, fsinfo wasn't on the table there. To me, notifications are a
completely separate issue, because you *can* get the information from
existing sources (ie things like /proc/mounts etc), and notification
seemed to be the much more fundamental issue.

If you poll for changes, parsing something like /proc/mounts is
obviously very heavy indeed. I don't find that particularly
controversial. Plus the notification queues had other uses, even if it
wasn't clear how many or who would use them.

But honestly, the actual fsinfo thing seems (a) overdesigned and (b)
broken. I've now had two different people say how they want to use it
to figure out whether a filesystem supports certain things that aren't
even per-filesystem things in the first place.

And this feature is clearly controversial, with actual discussion about it.

And I find the whole thing confusing and over-engineered. If this was
a better statfs(), that would be one thing. But it is designed to be
this monstoer thing that does many different things, and I find it
distasteful.  Yes, you can query "extended statfs" kind of data with
it and get the per-file attributes. I find it really annoying how the
vfs layer calls to the filesystems, that then call back to the vfs
layer to fill things in, but I guess we have that nasty pattern from
stat() already. I'd rather have the VFS layer just fill in all the
default values and the stuff it already knows about, and then maybe
have the filesystem callback fill in the ones the vfs *doesn't* know
about, but whatever.

But then you can *also* query odd things like mounts that aren't even
visible, and the topology, and completely random error state.

So it has this very complex "random structures of random things"
implementation. It's a huge sign of over-design and "I don't know what
the hell I want to expose, so I'll make this generic thing that can
expose anything, and then I start adding random fields".

Some things are per-file, some things are per-mount, and some things
are per-namespace and cross mount boundaries.

And honestly, the "random binary interfaces" just turns me off a lot.

A simple and straightforward struct? Sure. But this random "whatever
goes" thing? No.
