Thanks for the review and comments.  Responses below, but I'll post an
updated guidance doc in just a bit incorporating your feedback as well
as those of a few others who sent me comments off-list.

As far as moving this guidance into Documentation/security, yes, that
is the ultimate goal.  In fact I have a todo item to go through all of
Documentation/security and give it a good cleaning/review/edit,
although please don't expect that anytime soon :/

Good point, I'll remove that.

Agreed, although I think that's hard to properly describe that in a
sentence or two.  It's going to be impossible to capture every
requirement in this doc (I added a new paragraph explaining this in
the latest revision), so I think we can just leave this as-is for now.

If it does become a problem we can work a bit harder on describing
what makes a "good" LSM hook.

I'm open to new language here if you have some particular wording in mind?

Agree.

I was looking for the original comments from Arjan but couldn't find
them in an archive anywhere, if anyone has a pointer it would be great
to share that.

I believe that should be captured in the "requirements, goals, and
expected uses" portion of the requirement above, but if you believe it
should be more explicit let me know.

I added a test suite requirement to the latest revision.  I didn't
explicitly require kselftests, as not all current LSMs with tests make
use of kselftest, but I do think requiring some type of test suite is
important.

Of course not!  While I'm a big believer in manpages, I don't believe
that we need to make that an explicit requirement.  However, I would
expect that the documentation we do require would make it easier to
produce useful manpages.

Or in a separate standalone public repo if the tools are significantly
large (see the requirement below).
