As far as I know, the current stacking feature is implemented calling 
the entire hooks in order of 'lsm=' boot parameter. But our desire must 
be calling a proper hook at a time by a task's current LSM, for instance 
Apparmor 'or' SELinux instead of 'and'.

And so we have been considering adding two new hooks which work as the 
same as the origin hooks but additionally branch to a proper hook 
function with the information of current LSM by calling lsm_task_ilsm().

The following changes are a part of our approach,

------ code part ------
#define call_int_hook_by_ilsm(FUNC, ILSM, IRC, ...) ({                 \
        int RC = IRC;                                           \
        do {                                                    \
                struct security_hook_list *P;                   \
                int id; \
                                                                \
                id = (ILSM == LSMBLOB_INVALID) \
                        ? lsm_slotlist[0]->id \
                        : lsm_slotlist[ILSM]->id; \
                hlist_for_each_entry(P, &security_hook_heads.FUNC, list) { \
                        if (P->lsmid->slot != LSMBLOB_NOT_NEEDED && id 
!= P->lsmid->id) \
                                continue; \
                        RC = P->hook.FUNC(__VA_ARGS__);         \
                        if (RC != 0)                            \
                                break;                          \
                }                                               \
        } while (0);                                            \
        RC;                                                     \
})

[...]

int ilsm = lsm_task_ilsm(current);
ret = call_int_hook_by_ilsm(mmap_addr, ilsm, 0, addr);
------------

We are still worrying about the part of calling lsm_task_ilsm() with 
'current', it seems dangerous in some unknown cases.

What do you think about this approach, Casey?

Best regards,
Leesoo
