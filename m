Yes, as you said, currently blacklist entries from dbx for 
EFI_CERT_X509_SHA256_GUID or EFI_CERT_SHA256_GUID are applied 
everywhere, and does not satisfy the trust model for .platform keyring. 
We should fix this, but changing now might break some existing systems. 
Probably it should be discussed as separate thread from this patchset.
