Which are a real possibility given the CAAM's direct memory access.
We now have safe interfaces mainline wrapping it for HWRNG, crypto
acceleration and hopefully soon key sealing and I don't think throwing
existing kernel driver support away and inventing a new CAAM uAPI is a
practical alternative.

Exactly.

I'd appreciate your feedback on my CAAM series if you think the defaults
can be improved. Trusted keys are no longer restricted to TPMs,
so users of other backends shouldn't be dismissed, because one backend
can be used with fscrypt by alternative means.

The users I meant are humans, e.g. system integrators. They need to think about

burning fuses, signing bootloaders, verifying kernel and root file systems,

encrypting file systems and safekeeping their crypto keys. Ample opportunity for

stuff to go wrong. They would benefit from having relevant kernel functionality

integrate with each other instead of having to carry downstream patches, which
we and many others[1] did for years. We now finally have a chance to drop this
technical debt thanks to Sumit's trusted key rework and improve user security
along the way.

So, Eric, how should we proceed?
