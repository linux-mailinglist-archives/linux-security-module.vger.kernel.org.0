I guess we can't get rid of it due to the crazy macro stuff with loop
unrolling, BEFORE/AFTER blocks, etc.  Ooof.  If you were looking for
another example of why I don't really like these patches, this would
be a good candidate.

Thanks for testing it out.  Perhaps trying to move all of these hooks
to use the static_call approach was a mistake.  I realize you're doing
your best adapting the static_call API to support multiple LSMs, but
it just doesn't look like a good fit to me for the "unconventional"
hooks here in this patch.

I recognize that your comments are in reference to that last flaw
rooted in the hardware that used indirect calls at an attack vector,
but wasn't that resolved through other means?  I never saw the PoC or
had time to follow up on whatever mitigation was ultimately merged (if
any).  However, my understanding is that the move to static_calls is
not strictly necessary to patch over that particular hardware flaw, it
is just a we-really-want-this for either a performance or a
non-specific security reason; pick your favorite  of the two based on
your audience.

Regardless, since none of the previous suggestions/options proved to
be workable, I'm going to suggest we just kill this patch too and move
forward with the others.  I had hoped we could get the changes in this
patch cleaned up, but it doesn't look like that is going to be the
case, or at least not within a week or two, so let's drop it and we
can always reconsider this in the future if a cleaner implementation
is presented.
