At least from an IMA perspective, the IMA Kconfig selects "CRYPTO_SHA1", ma=
king
it the only crypto hash algorithm required to be built into the kernel.

As you explained in "[RFC PATCH v2 09/13] ima: invalidate unsupported PCR b=
anks
only once", not extending the TPM bank:
  b.) is a security risk, because the bank would validate an empty measurem=
ent
list.

The solution was to extend a padded SHA1 digest, which could still be verif=
ied.
The question boils down to whether extending the TPM bank with a valid, may=
be
deprecated hash algo, is better than not extending it at all.  Was that the
right solution?  I believe it was at the time.  SHA1 was being deprecated f=
or
specific use cases, not all usecases.

So the question is what to do going forward.

The downside, if none of the TPM bank hash algorithms are configured as bui=
ltin
in the kernel, is the lack of a measurement list.

True, not implementing the fallback is simpler, but it is their choice.

Agreed, using the open-writer/ToMToU integrity violation to indicate an
unsupported TPM bank would not be a good idea.

If the purpose of this patch set is to actually remove IMA's dependency on =
a
working SHA-1, at some point the Kconfig "select CRYPTO_SHA1" needs to be
removed.  Otherwise the kernel will be built with SHA1 builtin
(CONFIG_CRYPTO_SHA1=3Dy).

If the purpose of this patch set is preparatory for eventually removing the=
 SHA1
dependency, then the cover letter and the patch descriptions should indicat=
e
that.

Assuming the latter, other than updating the patch description, the patch i=
s
fine.

Before posting the non-RFC version of this patch, please trim the patch
description.
