Ok, fair enough.  I don't understand why you didn't do the revert since
it appears so trivial to you and this review and fix turned out to be
marginally more work.  I didn't understand what you wanted when you
referred to stable.

Well, considering that ghak96 ended up being a bugfix (that wasn't its
intent), I figured these audit_getcwd() were also bugfixes to prevent
the same BUG under different calling conditions.

Ok, so it sounds like rather than just fix it now, it would be better to
revert it, then submit *one* patch for ghak120 plus this fix that will
go tentatively upstream in 3 months, fully in 5.  Arguably the last
chunk above should be added to ghak96, so that should be reverted too,
then resubmitted with this added chunk (or it could be a fixup chunk
that would need to be sequenced with ghak120).  As for the middle two
chunks, they could either be resubmitted with a resubmitted ghak96, or
with a resubmitted ghak120.  As for the timing of all of these, ghak96
should be in place before the ghak120 patch, so even resubmitting one
patch for the combined ghak120 and ghak96 might make more sense.

I know you like only really minimal fixes this late, but this seemed
pretty minimal to me...
