Right, we can just miss the update of the interrupt flags and miss the 
loop and then afterwards the new flag gets set and we'd stall.

Right. For edge support I think we would need to avoid causing another 
interrupt (like locality change interrupt) before the interrupt handler 
hasn't finished dealing with an existing interrupt. Considering that 
Windows works on IRQ 13 (egde) and Linux driver cannot, I guess this is 
a good reason not to move QEMU TIS to IRQ 13 and try to support 
interrupts via ACPI table declaration.
