The following are steps for both proposals:

     the steps for trim N solution:
         1. User space reads list without lock
         2. User space decides to trim N entries and send command to kernel
         3. Kernel will lock the list use the same or less time as 
staged solution use(we can improve this together)

     the steps for staged N solution:
         1. User space reads list without lock
         2. User space stages list with lock
         3. User space decides to trim N entries and send command to kernel
         4. Kernel trim staged list (staged list may not empty after trim)
         5. kexec save the staged list during soft reboot
         6. kexec restore the staged list during soft reboot
