I agree. The sandboxer is a sample, and such sandboxer is not the best 
place to configure Landlock according to the app semantic. At the end it 
should be done in the app itself.

I would like this sample to be as simple as possible but still useful. 
To properly handle all "refer" use cases, it would require a dedicated 
configuration (e.g. LL_FS_REFER), which will make it more difficult to 
understand, and this approach will not scale with future (FS) access rights.

We can maybe add a comment in this sample to explain that. Your 
explanation looks like a good start. If you agree, could you send a 
patch to add such comment (on top of this series)?
