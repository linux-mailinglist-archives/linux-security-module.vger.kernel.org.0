Hi Gregory

all you said can be implemented by maintaining the PCR starting value
outside the system, in a trusted entity. This would allow the
functionality you are hoping for to validate the retained portion of
the measurement list.

Keeping the PCR starting value in the kernel has the potential of
misleading users that this is an information they can rely on. I would
rather prefer to not run in such risk.

From implementation point of view, it looks much simpler to me to
specify N relative to the current measurement list.

In my draft patch [1] (still need to support trimming N entries instead
of the full measurement list), the risk of concurrent trims does not
exist because opening of the snapshot interface is exclusive (no one
else can request trimming concurrently).

If a more elaborated contention of remote attestation agent is
required, that could be done at user space level. I'm hoping to keep in
the kernel only the minimum code necessary for the remote attestation
to work.
