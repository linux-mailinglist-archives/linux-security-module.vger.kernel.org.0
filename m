This makes sense, but there are a lot of stars in here. ;)

Yes, that's correct.

Nice!  I also agree with Daniel and Alejandro.

A bit of background on the rationale.  The particularity of scopes is
that they implicitly allow operations on the current or a nested domain.
With a handled field we would have needed to manually add exceptions for
processes in the current domain or a nested one, which would have been
possible with a new type of rule to identify relative domains (i.e. not
at ruleset creation time but at restriction time).  This new scope
semantic is easy to use, well specified (with this doc ;) ), and it
should fit to most sandbox use cases.  If we ever need a way to further
restrict the use of some IPC, we could still implement a new handled_*
field with the dedicated rule types, which could still compose with the
current scope.
