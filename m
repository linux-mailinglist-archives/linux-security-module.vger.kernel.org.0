ugh, that is a problem. we don't have a hook in fsmount(), the closest
we get is the dentry_open() hook, but I don't see how a call to that
could reasonably detect that its coming from fsmount.

I am not opposed to a new hook at all, and I will throw something together
but I don't see that going into 6.7

Sadly, yes I would have loved more testing, and I should have thought to
to poke you directly. I deliberately delayed sending this up during last
cycle when the report to kernel.org came in. I kicked a kernel with it over
to lxd (while still treating the issue as being in embargo. sigh, ...), and
then put it into the ubuntu proposed kernels and apparmor-next.

heard plenty on the user namespace mediation, but nothing of significance
around move_mount.
