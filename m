Not necessarily. Those security mechanisms are all optional mount
options under userspace control....

What does "generally expected to be safe" actually mean?

If be "safe" you mean "won't crash the kernel if the structure has
been altered in detectable ways with", then we already largely tick
that box. However, there are whole classes of DOS attacks that are
very difficult to detect without rigorous, expensive runtime
checking (e.g. loops in btree pointers).

Hence while we catch almost all the the obvious out-of-bounds
corruptions within an object, detecting corruptions that require
spanning a largely unbound number of objects to detect are not
handled at all. I can corrupt a filesystem to induce an endless
btree search loop like this pretty easily with a little bit of
xfs_db magic. Yup, we even provide the tools to make doing stuff
like this easy...

If by "safe" you mean "can detect all cases where a metadata field
or file data has been tampered with", then XFS is completely unsafe
and should not be used.

We can't detect that a malicious actor has changed something like a
file permission field or the contents of a security xattr.  To do
that requires cryptographically secure signatures of metadata
objects and file data. We do not have that sort of feature in the
on-disk format. We expect users that need protection from such
tampering will use an envrypted block device to prevent malicious
actors from being able to mutate the filesystem structure in this
way.

The concerns I have about malicious actors are not mitigated by the
language the filesystem is implemented in.

It has everything to do with the fact that a filesystem like XFS or
ext4 cannot detect someone changing permissions on a file to, say,
add a setuid bit to the permissions field and then hide the
modification by recalculating the correct CRC for the metdata block.

Solving that problem requires a fundamentally different fs/device
trust model (i.e. the device is *never* trusted) and an on-disk
format that is based around "trust nothing" rather than "trust
everything".
