There was no shortage of talks about using eBPF for security at LPC this we=
ek,
https://lpc.events/event/19/sessions/235/#all

If eBPF can't do what you want today, I suspect it will in the
not-too-distant future.
The best way to make it so would be to try implementing your desired
functionality using it, find the cases where it is currently
insufficient and then take those to LPC or other venues to argue for
enhancements to enable it to do so. Doing so may require re-thinking
how you implement that functionality to fit within the required safety
constraints but that doesn't mean it is impossible.

Not seeing an actual response from Paul in the archives, but did you
ever actually post patches to the list? Posting a GitHub URL is NOT a
real request for review.
