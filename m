Interesting... My ".config" also have this option "on" but this warning
never appeared. Under what circumstances did it happen? I tested this
patchset with two custom test programs with no problem. Maybe my tests
are not good enough :(

Ok, I will make the necessary changes in order to clarify the commented
points. I will also add the self-tests. Thanks for the suggestion.

Great, I will give it a try and study this hierarchy. If this is feasible,
the correct path shoud be to create a new security blob hold by the mm
struct? Also, I think that new LSM hooks will be needed to notify the
allocation, release and copy of this structure. What do you think, am I in
the right direction?

The first version computed the application crash period on the fly
(without a list) using the accumulated time and the number of faults.

period =3D time_since_execve / faults_since_execve;

But this method has two major drawbacks. The first (noted by Jann Horn),
is that if an application runs for a long time (say, a month) without any
crash, and the detection threshold is set to 30 s (default value), an
attacker can break the app approximately:

30*24*60*60/30 =3D 86400 times

before the detection is triggered.

The second drawback is that if the first fault is fast (from the execve
system call) the detection will be triggered instantly. This is a problem
if an application fails quickly for reasons that are not related to a real
attack.

I think to avoid the first drawback we can compute the crash period using
a kind of weighted average (setting more weight for the last time between
faults). But the second drawback does not go away.

However, with the list we don't have any of the commented drawbacks (only =
a
larger memory footprint and more calculation time).

Any ideas to remove the list are welcome ;)

Ok, I will try to play with privilege boundary crossing in the next
version.

Thanks, I will work on it and review the execve case. Also, thanks for
showing me real examples of fork brute force attacks ;)

Maybe the PR_SECURITY_FORK_BRUTE_DISABLE prctl can be used by applications
like "runc" (commented below) if we cannot exclude this false positive. I
mean during phases that may need fork and kill in a quick way. Then, durin=
g
other phases, the protection could be enabled again. Makes sense?

I agree. If possible, I will remove as much configuration as possible.

I will try to work on this as well.

It's a pleasure to work on this protection. This is the perfect task to
learn a lot.

Thank you very much for the review and all the comments. I know this
review was streamed on twitch but, due to my main language is not english,
I cannot follow speech the way I want. Will this video be uploaded to
youtube? There I can turn on the subtitles. This way I can learn and
improve more things. Thanks again.
