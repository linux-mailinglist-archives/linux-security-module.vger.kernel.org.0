This would work with the digest with a bit more code in fs-verity. It
also has benefits if there are other callers who want this information.

I was planning on grouping the digest and signature into 
apublic_key_signature
structure in v8 to pass the digest, digest algorithm,digest size, signature
and signature size (as opposed to defining a new structfor this purpose),
reducing the number of LSM hook calls down to one functionin fsverity.

I think both approaches have merit. fsverity_get_file_digest is more useful
if there are callers outside of LSMs that want this information. The LSM 
hook
is cleaner if only LSMs want this information.

At least, at the moment, it seems like it's only IPE who wants this 
information,
and it's not like it won't be able to change later if the need arises, 
as this
is all implementation details that wouldn't effect the end-user.

I'll defer to Eric - his opinion holds the most weight, as fsverity would be
the main code affected in either case.
