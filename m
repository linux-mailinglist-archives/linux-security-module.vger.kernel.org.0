The motivation for this patch set is convincing and addresses limiting the =
usage
of keys loaded directly or indirectly onto the system trusted keyrings -=
=20
.builtin, .machine, and .secondary_trusted_keys keyrings.  Pre-loading the =
build
time ephemeral kernel module signing key is a nice improvement from the pre=
vious
versions.  My main concern is not with Clavis per-se, but that the LSM
infrastructure allows configuring all the LSMs, but enabling at build time =
and
modifying at runtime a subset of them.  Without Clavis enabled, nothing cha=
nges
- any key on the system trusted keyrings remains usable for any purpose.  W=
ith
the current LSM design, the end user security threat model cannot be guaran=
teed.
