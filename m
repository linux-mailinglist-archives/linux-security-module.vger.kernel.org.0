We were asked to identify a case where upstream could be possibly
broken by the change in behavior, we did that.

It is now perfectly clear that the LSM maintainers don't consider the
possibility of breaking upstream BPF to be an issue of concern, no
doubt an important clarification for everyone moving forward.

FWIW, it would not seem unreasonable to assume that an LSM, BPF
included, may want to be notified of the the instantiation of the
security state of an inode, regardless of whether or not the LSM is
using extended attributes.

Requirement so noted.

Have a good week.
