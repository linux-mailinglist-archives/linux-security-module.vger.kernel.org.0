As discussed many times prior, I consider in-tree, upstreamed LSMs my
priority when it comes to decision making.  LSMs which are under
development and are working to be merged come next, and LSMs which
have decided to remain out-of-tree remain last.  I do not
intentionally plan to make life difficult for the out-of-tree LSMs,
but if that happens as a result of design decisions intended to
benefit in-tree LSMs that is acceptable as far as I am concerned.  You
are free to disagree, but I believe the policy I've described here is
consistent with the bulk of the other kernel subsystems and I have no
plans to change this policy.

Once again, we've already discussed this many, many times: out-of-tree
LSMs are not the priority and that is not going to change.  One
corollary of this is that we are not going to assign LSM IDs to LSMs
that remain out-of-tree as this would negatively impact the LSM layer
by cluttering/depleting the LSM ID space.  LSMs that are working
towards integration with the upstream Linux kernel can self-assign a
temporary LSM ID which will be finalized upon merging in the LSM tree.
Based on all of the arguments you have already submitted - and let us
be very clear: you are the only one speaking out against this - I see
no reason to change this policy.

> The LSM ID is not a API. The LSM ID is a publicly available database.

By every definition of "API" that I have ever seen, the LSM ID *is*
part of the proposed LSM syscall API.

In my last email in this thread I asked you to refrain from revisiting
old arguments.  Unfortunately you either chose to reject that request
or you mistakenly thought your latest email was presenting new ideas
as opposed to a slight reframing of your existing objections.  I am
sorry that we have reached this point, but I am done discussing this
with you Tetsuo; unless I see any new arguments from you this will be
my last reply to you on this topic.
