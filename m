I believe the intent is to only pause the measurements while the
snapshot_aggregate is generated, not for the duration of the entire
snapshot process.  The purpose of the snapshot_aggregate is to
establish a new root of trust, similar to the boot_aggregate, to help
improve attestation performance.

The current code has no provision for trimming the measurement log,
that's the primary reason.

Okay, we are starting to get closer, but I'm still missing the part
where you say "if you do X, Y, and Z, I'll accept and merge the
solution."  Can you be more explicit about what approach(es) you would
be willing to accept upstream?
