I'm far from an expert on RCU locking, but __list_splice_init_rcu()
provides an example of how to make sure there aren't any readers
traversing the list, before two lists are spliced together.   In our
case, after there aren't any readers, instead of splicing two lists
together, it should be safe to point to the new list.
