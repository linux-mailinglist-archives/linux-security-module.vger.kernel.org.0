I haven't had to look at the kernel init code in a while, and I don't
recall ever looking at the initramfs code, but I spent some time
digging through the code and I wonder if it would be possible to mark
the initramfs superblock in wait_for_initramfs() via a new LSM hook
using @current->fs->root.mnt->mnt_sb?  Although I'm not completely
sure that it's populated.  Have you already looked at an approach like
this?
