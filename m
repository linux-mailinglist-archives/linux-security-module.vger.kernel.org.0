This is from me, but do you think "reparenting a file hierarchy" is not 
confusing? What about "reparenting a file or a directory"? Not sure 
which one is better.

I'm not sure either if we should use "deny" or "forbidden". Is there a 
difference? According to https://www.wikidiff.com/deny/forbid it seems 
that "deny" would be more appropriate because Landlock rules add 
exceptions to a forbidden set of actions… However, "deny" needs to be 
followed by "access" for the same use, which makes your wording correct. 
Just a thought.

The files/directories don't grant accesses but the sandbox/domain do 
grant some accesses for a set of file hierarchies.

What about "Any forbidden actions on the source file must also be 
forbidden on the destination file."
Or "Any denied accesses on the source file…"

This seems a bit weird according to the previous "must hold for the 
access rights on the source and destination directory" though.

s/is required in the destination/must be granted for the destination/ ?

Same "must be granted for"
