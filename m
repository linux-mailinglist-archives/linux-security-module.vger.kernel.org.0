I've spent 6+ years working on this issue, with a focus on trusted
endpoint devices and their communications with trusted cloud
endpoints.

The challenge to trusted systems is that they not only have to be
secure, they have to be tractable for the general development
community to easily target, that is currently not the case.  Eric, as
you note, this extends to the notion of generic Linux distributions
being able to deliver this tractability and flexibility to their user
communities.

Making this happen requires a much more generic system for modeling
security behavior then what currently exists.  If one looks at how
security co-processors are going to evolve, this modeling will end up
going out of the kernel into external devices, which are not going to
be generic TPM's [*].

We have such an architecture for the 5.4 kernel, that with a little
luck, we hope to be able to release by mid-summer.  It peacefully
co-exists with all of the existing integrity infrastructure which
would make it tractable for a value add patch.

It includes a namespace implementation for the security event
modeling, without which, tractable trusted system development is a
non-starter.

If you are interested I will keep you in the loop.

Have a good day.

Greg
