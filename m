Sorry, late to the party.

I suppose I lost the argument that we shouldn't really be trusting any
certs from db when shim is in operation because they're all EFI binary
signing ones and will usually simply be the microsoft certificate and
possibly an OEM platform one and we're usually pivoting the root of
trust to the certificates in the MokList.

However, if we are going to do this, we should also be blacklisting the
certificates in MokListX which the OS sees through MokListXRT.  Since
MokListX is an essential piece of our revocation infrastructure it
should have been mentioned in the CVE but wasn't for some reason.
