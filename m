So here's the problem: if your current grub doesn't do any TPM
extensions (as most don't), then the two boot aggregates are the same
because PCRs 8 and 9 are zero and there's a test that doesn't add them
to the aggregate if they are zero.  For these people its a nop so we
shouldn't force them to choose a different version of the same thing.

If, however, you're on a distribution where grub is automatically
measuring the kernel and command line into PCRs 8 and 9 (I think Fedora
32 does this), your boot aggregate will change.  It strikes me in that
case we can call this a bug fix, since the boot aggregate isn't
properly binding to the previous measurements without PCRs 8 and 9.  In
this case, do we want to allow people to select an option which doesn't
properly bind the IMA log to the boot measurements?  That sounds like a
security hole to me.

However, since it causes a user visible difference in the grub already
measures case, do you have a current use case that would be affected? 
As in are lots of people already running a distro with the TPM grub
updates and relying on the old boot aggregate?
