Why not fix securityfs to provide pollable files?  Other than that, why
can't you just use securityfs?

You are creating a new structure-type-api here, why not use a
already-designed protocol instead like varlink if you need userspace to
parse events in an atomic way?  Or heck even json would be better as
there are universal userspace tools for that today.

Or use the audit interface, this feels very close to that, why not just
tie into that subsystem instead?
