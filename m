This is the expected behavior and the way the blacklist keyring is
currently used, as explained in the commit message:
"This enables to invalidate new certificates, either from being loaded
in a keyring, or from being trusted in a PKCS#7 certificate chain."

If you want a (trusted root) key to be untrusted, you need to remove it
from the keyring, which is not allowed for the builtin trusted keyring.
