Just curious: if an attacker takes control of the boot phase earlier
than the kernel, then not just this check has no value, but any check in
the kernel has no value, right? Anything that got loaded early enough
could theoretically patch the kernel with anything on anywhere. So shall
we just remove them all?

Certainly the answer is no, and they are still meaningful somehow and
somewhere. IMHO I think the concern behind the check is reasonable, but
the actual code could be an overkill. It would be better if it does:

  if (arch_ima_get_secureboot() && ima_mok_verify()) // hypothetical

, and in the future we could extend the ima policy for the boot phase
chain of trust and perform the check here accordingly, i.e. let the
users decide how things should go.

While for the current situation, my personal advice would be to add a
config to control whether or not the check is conducted. Let's call it
CONFIG_LOAD_UEFI_KEYS_STRICT temporarily:

#ifdef CONFIG_LOAD_UEFI_KEYS_STRICT
  /* the MOK/MOKx can not be trusted when secure boot is disabled */
  if (!arch_ima_get_secureboot())
          return 0;
#endif

so that both sides are happy, and we can think of more fine-grained
verification methods, like the one I said above, for the strict mode
afterwards.
