HWPARAM would prohibit the creation of a few special comedi devices such 
as those created by the "comedi_test" and "comedi_bond" drivers. 
(Although one dummy device does get created by the "comedi_test" module 
when it is loaded, and I don't know if anyone actually uses the 
"comedi_bond" driver!)

But then again, the changes to COMEDI_DEVCONFIG also prohibits the 
creation of those special devices, so I don't suppose it matters either way.

It works on automatically registered comedi devices too.  I suppose that 
could be done via the "unbind" file in the driver, but that goes through 
a different path and is a bit harder to use.
