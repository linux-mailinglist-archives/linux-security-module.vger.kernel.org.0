You are clearly the mechanistic expert on capabilities so we would
take your lead on this.

Some background information to hopefully assist in a discussion on the
types of capability checks that should be implemented.

The capability checks we apply in TSEM gate the following five types
of actions:

1.) The ability to issue TSEM control commands.

2.) The ability to register an event processing module.

3.) Access to state information on kernel based modeling agent instances.

4.) The ability to send signals to trust orchestration processes.

5.) The ability to send a signal to a different security modeling namespace.

If we understand the differentiation that you suggest between
CAP_MAC_ADMIN and CAP_MAC_OVERRIDE we would conclude the following:

Checks 1, 2 and 4 would seem, in our opinion, have the ability to
change the security state of a system.  As such it would seem
appropriate to use CAP_MAC_ADMIN for those checks.

Rather than belabor the issue now, we can entertain a subsequent
discussion, if needed, on why we believe that actions 1, 2 and 4 can
change the security state of the system.

By your definition, check type 3 would seem to be consistent with
CAP_MAC_OVERRIDE, since it is gating access to potentially security
sensitive information but which does not imply the ability to change
the security state of the system.

That leaves category 5 as a possible open question.  Given the trust
orchestration model for externally modeled namespaces, we concluded
that the only entities that should be able to issue signals that can
manipulate, particularly terminate a process, should only come from
within the security modeling namespace that the target process is
running in.  Given that, we would consider such operations as possibly
affecting the security state of the system and thus suitable for
CAP_MAC_ADMIN.

Based on what we have always understood, and that is confirmed by 'git
grep', the only thing at this time that is using CAP_MAC_OVERRIDE is
SMACK.  If our analysis is correct, would you have any issues with us
changing the type 3 checks to CAP_MAC_OVERRIDE?

With respect to the check that you call out in
tsem.c:tsem_open_file(), the capability check is to avoid a model
deadlock situation.  If we adopt the model we discuss above, we would
need to unequivocably allow the open if the process is carrying
CAP_MAC_ADMIN or CAP_MAC_OVERRIDE in order to avoid a control
deadlock.

We will look forward to your thoughts on if we should proceed with the
above changes.

Have a good day.

As always,
Dr. Greg
