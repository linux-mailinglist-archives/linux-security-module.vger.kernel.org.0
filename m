Yes

There is no issue using cred_alloc_blank() and then transfer_creds().
The allocation is up front and transfer_creds() cannot failed.

I was thinking to do the same as seccomp: lock siglock and,
check/synchronize credentials in a new LSM hook called just after
copy_seccomp() (when siglock is locked).  However, as pointed out by
Jann, that would not be enough because this new LSM hook would not be
able to allocate new credentials, and the siglock locking happens after
copy_creds().

This looks good.  Too bad we need to block all threads.
