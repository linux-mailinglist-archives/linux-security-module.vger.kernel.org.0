The only thing we agreed upon is that you would respond the thread
to update your sorting things out with Michal.

As for the discussion, I will repeat what I said in our conversation
that the discussion will be lot more productive after making amends
with the community. I stand by that assessment.

I will also repeat what I said that the discussion and debate is
outside the scope of the current issue the Code of Conduct Committee
is trying to resolve.

I didn't pick up on your desire to apologize after the discussion in
our conversation.

Are you saying you will be happy to make amends with an apology after
the discussion and debate?

thanks,
-- Shuah (On behalf of the Code of Conduct Committee)
