Sure, I'm happy with this. My comment was originally to the first half
of your response ("the IMA approach of calculating the file digest
could be used"); I don't see that as part of IPE's purpose.

I wanted to draw as rough boundary between what I find acceptable
as an IPE extension and what isn't.
