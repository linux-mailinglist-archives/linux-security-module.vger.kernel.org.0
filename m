Thanks for the answer!

Unfortunately, these restrictions also make it impossible to use eBPF
effectively for security. We can certainly discuss the limitations
themselves if needed, but that=E2=80=99s not the main point I=E2=80=99m try=
ing to make
here.

Right, and that=E2=80=99s a well-known issue that has no clean solution oth=
er
than backporting. I completely agree with that.

I was under the impression that there was something of that sort.
For example: https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v3.10/source/include/linux/se=
curity.h#L1688
It may not have been =E2=80=9Cofficially=E2=80=9D exported, but people who =
needed it
simply resolved the symbol through `kallsyms` or a kprobe and used it.
I=E2=80=99m not claiming that this is good practice, but it did work.

Consider the case where an attacker already has root access. The first
thing they typically do is disable or tamper with security tools.
After that, they establish persistence. Access-control models alone
are not enough here =E2=80=94 sometimes they need to be adjusted dynamicall=
y,
based on complex real-time analysis.

> What APIs do you want? It's possible that some exist that you haven't

I=E2=80=99m confident I=E2=80=99ve studied all the mechanisms available for=
 real-time
system protection. I=E2=80=99ve even given talks and published material on
approaches to securing Linux.
I may not have covered every LSM module in depth, but in practice they
simply don=E2=80=99t provide the capabilities required for modern security
workloads.

And I don=E2=80=99t want to sound overly categorical, but the current path =
of
security development feels like a dead end to me, for several reasons.
Modern security relies on analyzing hundreds of thousands of events
per second. eBPF isn=E2=80=99t particularly fast to begin with, and on top =
of
that it imposes strict technological limitations that prevent
meaningful in-kernel analysis. Every EDR vendor ends up doing the same
thing: collecting raw data (which is already difficult) and pushing it
into userspace for processing. That adds transport overhead on top of
everything else.

Or, of course, writes a dirty and unsafe kernel module. For me in the
perfect world seems to it's better to provide an API for userspace.
It's safe enough and doesn't contain a restriction that eBPF has.

> Please propose the interfaces you want. An API definition would be

I=E2=80=99m lucky enough to have already built a working prototype, which I
once offered for review:

https://github.com/Linux-Endpoint-Security-Framework/linux/tree/esf/main/se=
curity/esf
https://github.com/Linux-Endpoint-Security-Framework/linux/tree/esf/main/in=
clude/uapi/linux/esf

Less lucky was the reaction I received. Paul Moore was strongly
opposed, as far as I remember. Dr. Greg once said that heat death of
the universe is more likely than this approach being accepted into the
kernel.

I don=E2=80=99t want to =E2=80=9Cpoke old wounds=E2=80=9D, but the design I=
 proposed was
largely inspired by Apple=E2=80=99s Endpoint Security Framework (originally
=E2=80=9Cmac policies=E2=80=9D):
https://developer.apple.com/documentation/endpointsecurity

In my view, it is an exemplary model. The kernel provides a consistent
stream of events to userspace, hides the complexity of data collection
and transport, and ensures fault-tolerance if userspace fails to
process events quickly enough.
Audit, for comparison, simply hangs the system if its buffer
overflows. ESF does not have that problem and even lets userspace
control the event stream.

> There are numerous cases where LSMs have mitigated attacks. One case:

And there are thousands of cases where LSMs did not. Most companies
never disclose successful breaches because of NDAs and fear of
investor backlash. The few disclosures we see typically appear only
when it=E2=80=99s safe for the company, or when they specifically want to
appear transparent.

Which literature do you mean?
As I mentioned above, public reports about successful attacks are rare.

Maybe I poorly delivered my point. I'll try again.

The strongest protection on Linux today is provided by proprietary
security vendors. Unfortunately, they often achieve this using
kernel-module =E2=80=9Chacks=E2=80=9D rather than LSMs. It=E2=80=99s not be=
cause they prefer
hacks =E2=80=94 it=E2=80=99s because Linux doesn=E2=80=99t offer proper API=
s to implement the
required functionality.

In practice, most LSM modules are either disabled or misconfigured on
real servers, and the responsibility falls on AV/EDR vendors. As
someone who has been building such systems professionally for years, I
can say with confidence: there is no clean, reliable mechanism
available today.
As much as I love Linux, its security and its friendliness toward
security vendors are its weak side.

In the real world, deploying a modern security product means dealing
with endless pain: missing kernel headers (sometimes there isn=E2=80=99t ev=
en
Internet access to download them), unstable kernel APIs, lack of BTF,
constant fights with the eBPF verifier, and all the other limitations
of eBPF.

To be honest, many developers =E2=80=94 and I=E2=80=99m taking the liberty =
to speak
broadly here =E2=80=94 would simply like to see something similar to Apple=
=E2=80=99s
ESF available on Linux.
