I need to climb on an airplane in less than 24 hours to fly to Aspen

Stated more precisely, the model is asynchronous behavioral controls
and model response.

It is currently what 100+ billion dollar security companies and their
products are based on.  Which, in an increasingly wide swath of
corporate IT, you are required to implement.

Kernel security maintainers can choose to ignore the issue, doesn't
mean it isn't reality.

We have a very diverse team, members of which have been involved in
international cybersecurity issues that have been in the news.  I've
personally written white papers for the consumption of individuals
that are in the news, as to the socio-technical issues that are behind
why we can't have nice things in cybersecurity.

We believe Linux can improve on this situation.  We at least look on
it as fortunate to have a public record as to why that may not be
possible, if that turns out to be the case.

For the official record, a number of your assessments above are
incorrect and do not reflect our implementation or intentions.

It doesn't seem to be a worthwhile expenditure of anyone's time to
discuss technical specifics.

We will remain content to be 'The Ghost of Christmas Yet To Come'.

Best wishes for a productive remainder of the week to everyone.
