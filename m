Yep, that was my plan for v2. :)

I was also wondering about adding a tracepoint for ruleset creation.
This one would print the ruleset's attributes as an array.

That would indeed be useful to see final access decisions.  It might be
a bit tricky to generically handle all the allowed access but I'll try
something.

Aren't kprobes/kretprobes enough for performance measurement?  They can
also be used with current kernels.

This landlock_check_fs_enter event would only be called after the
landlock_get_applicable_subject() check though.
