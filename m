Hi Michael, folks,

Apologies for the slow follow-up, I was ill over the last week of May & 
start of June.

I see your point here. The implementation may be Micron specific but 
there are probably ways to improve the generic locking APIs to cover 
these features.

I'm happy to look at what Tudor was working on, have any patches been 
posted for this? I've searched the mailing list history for the past few 
months but can't find any.

Looking at https://docs.kernel.org/admin-guide/tainted-kernels.html, I 
can't see any taint flag (tainted state bit) that would apply for the 
case when raw commands are sent to a hardware device. I may be 
misunderstanding something though - which tainted state bit would be set 
by this operation?

For the Advanced Sector Protection commands I can look into extending 
the existing IOCTLs if that's the preferred approach.

For the A-CRTM operations, these don't fit well into the existing APIs. 
Furthermore, for several of these operations the bytes sent over the SPI 
bus consist of a message block (including an opcode/sub-opcode and any 
arguments) followed by a HMAC signature of the message block. The 
signing key for this HMAC is typically kept off the device itself (e.g. 
in an on-site server or a cloud-based Key Management System). This means 
that the sequence of bytes to be sent over the SPI bus is typically 
produced by a system which has access to the signing key and is then 
sent to the target device to be relayed over the SPI bus to the Authenta 
flash device. The kernel running on a system with an Authenta flash 
device is typically not in a position to construct and sign the sequence 
of bytes to be sent over the SPI bus for A-CRTM commands.

So, I think the best API for A-CRTM operations would be a pair of 
vendor-specific IOCTLs, WR_CRTM_CMD and RD_CRTM_CMD, which each take an 
array of bytes, including any HMAC signature, to be sent over the SPI 
bus to the Authenta flash device. These would check the 
opcode/sub-opcode to ensure that they represent a valid A-CRTM command 
and for RD_CRTM_CMD to also check that this is an A-CRTM command that 
does not modify the device state or flash contents. Thus WR_CRTM_CMD 
requires the device to be opened for writing, RD_CRTM_CMD only requires 
the device to be opened for reading. Once the opcode/sub-opcode has been 
checked the command would be sent to the Authenta flash device and the 
response sent back to userspace.
