Yikes!  This is some pretty serious mail thread crime ...

The code sorta cares about ordering, at least to the extent that the
LSMs will behave differently depending on the ordering, e.g. a LSM
lower in the priority order might never "see" an operation if a higher
priority LSM rejects the operation.  Yes, it's an implementation
quirk, but I'm not sure I want to start messing with the
fail-on-first-error logic right now.  Maybe once we've got the LSM
layer fully stackable and we've gotten past the initial support
nightmare of that we can revisit this idea.

I personally would like to preserve the existing concept where "built"
does *not* equate to "enabled" by default.

My current opinion is that enabling a LSM and specifying its place in
an ordered list are one in the same.  The way LSM stacking is
currently done almost requires the ability to specify an order if an
admin is trying to meet an security relevant operation visibility
goal.

We can have defaults, like we do know, but I'm in no hurry to remove
the ability to allow admins to change the ordering at boot time.
