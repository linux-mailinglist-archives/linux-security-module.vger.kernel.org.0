Agreed. I particularly like how deleting the file wipes the secret from memory.

Indeed.

I think we should avoid 'secret', to be honest. Even if protected KVM
is not riding the SEV/TDX wave, I think confidential computing is
still an accurate description of its semantics.

Do you mean cache clean+invalidate? Better to be precise here.
