Paul, Linus,

Thank you for discussing the reasoning behind this patch. We wanted to
share how Android will leverage the new hooks introduced here.
Hopefully, this should help move forward this discussion and show why
these changes have concrete value to projects using SELinux like
Android.

Android, for a long time, has used the module loading hooks to ensure
that kernel modules are loaded from cryptographically signed,
dm-verity protected partitions. Even if an attacker compromised a
userspace process with CAP_SYS_MODULE, they cannot leverage this to
load modules from outside of protected partitions.

The changes presented in this merge request build upon this functionality.

Taking one example from this merge request: kexec image loading.

Currently, any process which has CAP_SYS_BOOT can use kexec to replace
the existing kernel. Android has 5 processes with CAP_SYS_BOOT, only 1
of which needs kexec functionality [1]. By using these new
permissions, we will ensure that this process is able to call kexec,
while prohibiting other processes. SELinux provides us strong, kernel
enforced guarantees which can be checked at policy compile time.
Extending on this, we will use this patchset to guarantee that kernels
and ramdisks executed by kexec come from known, good sources.

The other hooks are of similar value to Android.

Thiebaud and Nick
