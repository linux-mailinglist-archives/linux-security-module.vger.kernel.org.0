I could see where the user would want to use both. With Micka=C3=ABl =
Sala=C3=BCn=E2=80=99s
series, the blacklist keyring is updated immediately.  However it does
not survive a reboot.  With my patch, the blacklist keyring is updated
during boot, based on what is in the dbx. Neither approach needs a new=20=

kernel build.
