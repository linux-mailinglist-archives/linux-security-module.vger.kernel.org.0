Yes, I get the feeling you're right.

It'd be nice to simply say "you can only enable the caps you know
about, bit by bit."  The problem is, we have distributions, and we
have containers, and demanding that all filecap-enabled binaries be
fixed up every time you switch to a new kernel with more or fewer
capabilities is unworkable.

One thing we could do is declare that bit nbits-1 (63 in 64 bit caps)
means "all caps that the kernel knows about."  If 63 and any other
caps are enabled, then -EINVAL.  If/when we switch to 128 bit caps,
then bit 63 becomes a valid cap there, and 127 is 'all'.

Of course that's not at all backward compatible, so would have to be
done in a new capability version.
