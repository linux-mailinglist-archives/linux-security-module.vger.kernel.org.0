Yes. However with your comment I'm now realizing there's an issue if the
set of supported hash algorithms differs between the previous and the
next, kexeced kernel -- something I admittedly hadn't thought of before.

The current behavior as implemented in this RFC is that an unsupported
PCR bank would get invalidated *once* upon first use, i.e. extended once
with e.g. all 0xFEs. (Note that the actual patch implements invalidation
with all 0xFFs, for the choice of the exact invalidation value see
below). The idea is that
a.) tools could easily recognize this by comparing the PCR bank value
    against constant HASH(00 .. 00 | fe ... fe)
b.) and they would fail to verify any non-trivial event log against such
    a PCR bank if they did not do that comparison ahead.

In order to implement this invalidate-once logic, there's that
ima_extended_pcrs_mask you asked about in reply to [3/7], the
preparatory patch for [4/7] ("ima: track the set of PCRs ever
extended"). As the set of PCRs ever to be found in any policy rule
cannot be predicted, their unsupported banks cannot get invalidated once
at __init. Hence this inalidate-at-first-extend logic, which needs that
tracking of PCRs ever extended as maintained in ima_extended_pcrs_mask.

Upon kexec, the current patchset attempts to restore the
ima_extended_pcrs_mask from the previous kernel by walking through the
measurement list, setting a bit for each PCR found in any event.

Now consider the following:
- some hash algorithm is supported by the initially booted kernel,
- but not in the subsequently kexeced one.

The initially booted kernel would not invalidate the given hash
algorithm's bank for any PCR, and the kexeced one would neither, because
it would restore the ima_extended_pcrs_mask from the initially booted
one. However, the kexeced kernel would also not extend any further
events into the now unsupported PCR banks then. That means that these
PCR banks would happily verify a measurement list truncated to the point
before the kexec, which is of course bad.


I can see two ways around this:
a.) Give up on the invalidate-once scheme, unconditionally invalidate
    unsupported banks (with 0xfe .. fe) for every new measurement list
    entry.

b.) Make the kexeced kernel to read back PCR banks it doesn't support
    from the TPM at __init and see if they had been invalidated by the
    previous kernel. Set the bit in ima_extended_pcrs_mask *only* if so.
    That is, invalidate unsupported and not yet invalidated PCR banks
    upon first use.

    Also, make it read PCR banks it does support and refrain from
    further extending any found to have been invalidated before (for all
    PCRs mentioned in the measurement list). That is, leave previously
    invalidated PCR banks alone.

Going with a.) would mean that verifiers would not be able to recognize
in O(1) anymore that some bank was unsupported and had not been
maintained by the kernel. It would still be possible to figure in linear
time whether neither of the kernels in a kexec chain covered by a single
measurement list did support a given PCR bank hash.

For implementing b.), one would have to store a table of precomputed
HASH(00 .. 00 | fe .. fe) values for every recognized hash possible in
.rodata for comparison purposes, i.e. for every entry in
tpm2_hash_map[5] at least -- after all, the whole point is to deal with
hashes for which no implementation is available to the kernel, so these
values cannot get computed dynamically at runtime.

With that, if the initially booted kernel did not support some hash
algorithm, it would be recognizable by verifiers in O(1) time.

If the initially booted kernel did support a given hash, but a
subsequent kernel in the kexec chain would not, the PCR would get
invalidated by the latter. This sitatuation cannot be detected at all
(with reasonable effort) from the final PCR hash bank value alone and
verification against it would fail then. Perhaps it's noteworthy that
this is true with any possible scheme, including the currently
implemented one extending with padded SHA1 into unsupported banks.


I think that the decision about what to do now boils down to whether
there's any value in verifiers being able to tell that a PCR bank had
been unsupported and not been maintained rather than to simply fail its
verification if attempted.

If it is not important, or linear time + the additional implementation
complexity burden at the verifier side is acceptable, the much simpler
a.) would do.

Otherwise I could give implementing b.) a try and see how bad the
resulting code would get.

What do you think?

Yeah, there's indeed an ambiguity. I think the right thing to do is to
make measurement lists unverifiable against unsupported banks and would
propose to use 0xfe ... fe for the associated invalidations instead of
the 0xff .. ff used for violation events already.

Thanks a lot!
