Why is an explicit ioctl() necessary after EACCEPTCOPY? Or why is mprotect() not sufficient?

I tend to agree on Andy's MAXPERM model where MAXPERM never changes once established.

I'm not sure on what security_enclave_load()'s decision would be based.

What are the "unnecessary states" removed? 

I'm not sure understand the proposal fully. The whole thing looks to me like the driver is undertaking things that should/would otherwise be done by mmap()/mprotect() syscalls. It also imposes unnecessary restrictions on user mode code, such as mmap(PROT_NONE), ACTIVATE_REGION can be called only once, etc. What'd happen if ACTIVATE_REGION is called with a range spanning multiple/partial VMAs? What'd happen if an enclave was unmapped than mapped again? I'd say the proposal is unintuitive at least.

In theory, if the driver can keep track of MAXPERM for all pages within an enclave, then it could fail mmap() if the requested prot conflicts with any page's MAXPERM within that range. Otherwise, MAXPERM could be copied into VM_MAY* flags then mprotect() will just follow through. Wouldn't that be a much simpler and more intuitive approach?
