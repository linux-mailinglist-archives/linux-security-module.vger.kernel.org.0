It may very well be the case that namespaces are the worst abomination
that has ever been foisted on mankind with respect to security.

Unfortunately, that doesn't negate the fact that the software industry
has spoken and the notion of a 'container' or 'resource namespace',
whatever parlance one chooses to use, is now deeply ingrained in how
software is being developed and delivered and this will probably be
the case for the foreseeable future.

This thread was initiated by the fact that their is an expectation,
that will only grow in the future, that security controls can be
scoped to a subdivision less than that of an entire system and in a
manner that doesn't cause one security policy to interfere with or
complicate the implementation of another.

If current industry experience is any example, the one causing the
most problems will get turned off.  Or administrators will be left
trying to reason as to what security controls are actually being
achieved, which is always hazardous.

With respect to our work, if you believe that we are looking at a
namespace as an isolation concept you have misunderstand our
motivations, objectives and implementation.

The LSM infrastructure represents the basis set of information that
can be used to model the security behavior of a platform.  If it does
not, it cannot adequately enforce effective security controls, since
by definition, it would have insufficient visibility into all security
relevant behavior.

There are at least three ways this information can be used:

The LSM can be used to enforce a system wide security policy through
mandatory access controls, your area of interest and endeavor.

An equally valid concept is for developers to use this information
to verify that the security behavior of workloads that they develop
are consistent with what they desire.

A third possible use case of the LSM, since it represents access to
all of the information that describes the security state of a
platform, is to drive machine learning based analysis and
interpretation of the security status of a system.

The latter two use cases benefit from the ability to reduce the scope
and complexity of the model being analyzed, which is the intent of the
TSEM security modeling namespaces.

I'm just hazarding a guess here, no judgement implied, but I would
assume you view phenomenological modeling, machine learning and
artificial intelligence as irrelevant endeavors with respect to
security?

We have direct and constant dialogue with a group that has around 6000
virtual machines running 30,000+ containers at any given instant in
time.  Every VM is running, I believe, three CrowdStrike kernel
modules and other supportive infrastructure that are feeding 'machine
learning' telemetry into the cloud for security analysis.  I also
believe there are Kubernetes sidecars analysing container behavior in
the mix as well.

None of which is optional, given that the conversations surrounding
the technology consists of; "Run this because our insurance says we
have to".

The beauty in Linux is that you can ignore all of this and run
SeLinux, but to say that resoure namespaces, compartmentalization and
modeling are irrelevant, flies in the face of how security is being
done.

Personally, I've actually got two years on that, started with writing
assembler code to modify the functionality of RDOS running on Data
General Nova 2's, circa 1976.  Edited microcode to fix the 'tired
microcode' problems on DG Eclipses.  Even built and ran a
supercomputer center for about 6-7 years.  Spent a ton of time in the
last few years writing micro-controller code to implement hardware
Trusted Modeling Agents, so I think I've been full circle as well.

If we can put personal length issues aside, we can turn to the question
of security controls tuned to the needs of a workload.

Based on your comment above, I assume your position would be that
'Default deny, exception allow' security policies are inadequate or
unsafe?

There is probably no use drilling down too much further into technical
details until we can reach that point of understanding.

I wasn't being flippant or disparaging, please do not suggest malign
intent where it does not exist.

I will stand informed that you and others considered the notion of
something equivalent to Linux namespaces or workloads and discarded
them as useless, perhaps for very good reasons given the objectives you
were attempting to achieve.

Perhaps, unforunately, the rest of the world has gone in a different
direction and now has expectations and needs that are influenced by
the road that was chosen.

Two comments:

I find your observation that resource namespaces are expensive
interesting.  While they may not provide the degree of isolation you
are interested in, one of the issues that drove their adoption was
some degree of isolation with lower overhead than full virtualization.

Secondly, I believe that an unjaded observer would not consider TSEM
security modeling namespaces to require complex administrative
overhead.  Is there something about the usage examples and/or their
description in the documentation that suggests the degree of
complexity required to use them even approaches that of an OCI
orchestrator?

First, we are not selling anything, we are attempting to contribute
infrastructure to the common good to implement a security model that
we have worked to significantly document the rationale for.

Once again, TSEM 'namespaces' are not a mechanism for imposing
isolation, they are about limiting the scope of acceptable security
behaviors that can be exhibited by a process heirarchy.

This allows a development team to impose a requirement that the
workload block, through the use of mandatory controls, any security
behavior that the application has not been unit tested to, without the
need to engage systems administration support.

Since the behaviors are workload specific there is less opportunity
for the controls to 'break' the application.  Which, based on our
reasonably significant field experience and depending on the
environment, results in an order being given to turn off the controls.

None of this limits the ability of the system administrators to impose
more rigid controls in pursuit of a whole system security policy if
that is a desired goal of the architecture.

With respect to modeling of security behavior, a namespace is a
mechanism for reducing model complexity, which in turn increases the
accuracy of the model prediction.

If one doubts the importance of this concept in the modern enterprise
security environment, I can go into stories about running uname, on a
Linux box running an Oracle database implementation, setting off
security policy alarms that bring in the security team and the need to
write a formal security violation explanation.

If there would be interest, I can post a link to a reasonably current
review paper on the application of machine learning to system call
analysis for Host Intrusion and Anomaly detection.  It specifically
calls out the need to focus on driving the model at workload scope in
order to increase prediction accuracy.

One of the forward looking objectives of TSEM namespaces is to drive
models from the LSM level that, again by definition, has the most
complete visibility into the security state of the system.

We have a TMA model implementation, that reads the SeLinux extended
security attribute and role information and uses those in the
computation of the allowed security state coefficients that would be
representative of the MAC status of a workload.  The TSEM
documentation discusses the relationship between security state
coefficients and positive AVC nodes in the 'Security Event Modeling'
section, starting at line 204.

My comments would have been framed around the experience and insights
that work gave us with respect to the challenges associated with label
based object sharing and possible responses to those issues that TSEM
would facilitate.

We don't blow smoke, but we are sensitive to the fact that people
don't like to read much anymore.

Interesting.

So, by extentive reasoning, if we make security more complex, arcane
and brittle; in an environment where professional security experience
is increasingly limited, our systems will become more secure?

I guess history will judge.

No, the only Hillbilly thing we have here is a guy on the lake who has
two 4x8 sheets of green treated plywood nailed together with 50 gallon
plastic barrels on each corner pushed around by a five horse Evinrude.

More directly to your point, you're misrepresenting our intentions, we
are not suggesting we leave it to end users.

As noted above, we have pretty solid feedback from groups who are
deeply involved with infrastructure security that believe there are
positive benefits to development teams being able to independently
verify and protect the security of their workloads.

If this works to increase the security posture of the systems in
question, end users of the service would obviously seem to benefit.

Hopefully, if people have elected to read this far, they will at least
entertain the notion that our efforts are not as witless as has been
suggested.

Every technical issue involves shades of grey but TSEM is not about
isolation, or sharing, for that matter.  It is about defining whether
or not a workload is acting consistently with what it was designed and
intended to do and either acting in response or signaling that fact to
others, in as precise a manner as can be implemented.

It attempts to do this in what is, at least currently, within the
context of the technology framework that industry has chosen to
operate in.  This of course leaves open the question if industry has
chosen properly, which is something that neither one of us is going to
do anything about.

Best wishes for a productive remainder of the week.
