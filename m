The Linux kernel is complex and the link between the VFS and named UNIX
sockets is "special" (see the linked GitHub issue).  Landlock doesn't
handle named UNIX sockets yet for the same reason it doesn't handle some
other kind of kernel resources or access rights: someone needs to
implement it (including tests, doc...).  There is definitely interest to
add this feature, it has been discussed for some time, but it's not
trivial.  It is a work in progress though:

Contributions are welcome!
