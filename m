Agreed. The counter shouldn't be part of a config file.

IMA log already provides a trustworthy, tamper-resilient mechanism
to store such data.

The current design already provides the mechanism to store
the counter as part of the snapshot_aggregate event.

See section "D.1 Snapshot Aggregate Event" in the proposal for
reference.

Snapshot_Counter   := "Snapshot_Attempt_Count="
                               <num. snapshot attempts>


"snapshot_aggregate" becomes the first event recorded in the
in-memory IMA log, after the past entries are purged to
a shard file.  Along with the other benefits, the "snapshot_aggregate"
event also provides info to UM clients about how many snapshots are
taken so far.


See section "C.2 High-level Work-flow" in the proposal for more
info.

           Step #f
           ---------
      (In-memory IMA log)
    .----------------------.
    | "snapshot_aggregate" |
    | Event #E4            |
    | Event #E5            |
    '----------------------'
