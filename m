Yes, we definitely need tpm2_key_ecdsa, and that is actually probably
more important than RSA but I think both are needed. It was easier to
use RSA to carve stuff to fit as there some off-the-shelf code that
could be modified for the purpose.

I was already considering do we need the encoder at all but I think
for dynamic assets like octect strings and variable size integers
it has its place. Obviously is not very mature at this point.

I think I keep the "dump" strategy for RSA keys at least for first
to keep the series as tight as possible but at least v3 included
already a patch to make asn1_encode_integer() eat variable size
stuff:

https://lore.kernel.org/linux-integrity/20240521152659.26438-3-jarkko@kerne=
l.org/

So my proposal here is that I land RSA keys without using encoder
but that said it can take them into use in ECDSA keys when the
encoder has been carved up properly. There's already bunch of
things changed in v4, so thus I did not want to keep this
in that series:

https://lore.kernel.org/linux-integrity/20240522005252.17841-1-jarkko@kerne=
l.org/

I.e. the dump can be considered as first iteration. There's
bunch of uses for these keys, e.g. WIFI passwords, Ethereum
keypairs (requires ECDSA) and many others. It is really awesome
application feature for TPM2.

BR, Jarkko
