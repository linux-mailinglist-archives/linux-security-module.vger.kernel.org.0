That's not exactly correct.  Nothing needs to have "witnessed" the
starting PCR value because the quote vouches for it (and can vouch for
it after the fact).  The only thing you need to verify the quote is the
attestation key and the only thing you need to do to trust the
attestation key is ensure it was TPM created.  All of that can be
verified after the fact as well.  The only thing that can be done to
disrupt this is to destroy the TPM (or re-own it).

Remember the assumption is you *also* have the removed log shard to
present.  From that the PCR state of the starting quote can be
calculated and checked for matching the quote.  If you lose that, it's
equivalent to the log being tampered with and all bets are off.  The
assumption is that because of the impossibility of engineering TPM
extensions, it should be impossible to come up with a fake log that
produces the PCRs of the real one.  If that's violated, then IMA itself
becomes useless.
