yes, there needs to be mediation happening earlier as well. The goal
here wasn't complete new mount api mediation, which is something that
we have been meaning to address but haven't been able to yet.

This was specifically about addressing move_mount() which can also
be used to move existing mounts in the system. While fixing that the
question is do we care about detached mounts, yes, and should we
address them to the point that we can within the current mediation,
that is to gate them on very course is mount mediation allowed, and from
a security perspective that is a yes too.

Under the new mount api, even if we are mediating at the other points
brought up below, we still want to be mediating the move_mount
because apparmor very much cares where these mounts end up in
the mount tree.

agreed.
