No doubt about that, I'll drop the "counter-intuitive" part. Even now
(or by 2030 to be more specific), it should be only FIPS users caring
about SHA1 in this context at all.

Yes. Just for the record, going forward SHA256 will be, with [v2 05/13]. So
unless the SHA256 bank is disabled by firmware, it should be fine then.

The point I was trying to make is that no tool currently exists that
would successfully verify a /sys/*/*runtime_measurements_sha256 with
SHA1s template hashes in it. keylime would not as outlined above, and
ima-evm-utils ima_measurement command wouldn't either, because it works
only on /sys/*/*runtime_measurements_sha1 to begin with. (I previously
missed the latter fact, but its ima_verify_template_hash() does a
hard-coded SHA1). That is, ima_measurement's fallback logic only
applies to the PCR validations, not to the sysfs files.

I should have described it better. In the first step at least, the goal
is to remove the runtime dependency only. Because when SHA1's
->fips_allowed in crypto/testmgr.c gets flipped to false, SHA1
instantiation would fail with -ENOENT if the kernel was booted with a
fips=3D1 on its command line. Users not interested in FIPS, i.e. the vast
majority, might still want to use SHA1 and there's no real reason not
to.

But yes, it would definitely make sense to drop the CRYPTO_SHA1 dep, at
least at some point. Perhaps by simply moving it to the new
IMA_COMPAT_FALLBACK_TPM_EXTEND. I would personally not do that now
though, just in case there'll be some unexpected fallout from this
series.
