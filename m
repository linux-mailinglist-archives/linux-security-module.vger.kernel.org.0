And I agree with that. I'm saying that if we push it all in subj= then it is 
not a big penalty. It saves major breakage. Every single event is required to 
have a subj= field if its a MAC system. By changing it to lsm_subj= it changes 
the layout of every single event. And it make more to parse. And searching 
the labels is worse because it has to iterate over a list of *_subj to match 
it. This will hurt performance because it is for every single event.

It changes all knowledge of where to look for things. And considering 
considering that events could be aggregated from systems of different ages/
distributions, audit userspace will always have to be backwards compatible.

Common Criteria as well as other standards require subject labels to be 
searchable. So, changing behavior based on how many modules will still cause 
problems with performance because I'll always have to assume it could be 
either way and try both.

Why would not multiplexing different labels in the same field be a big win? Its 
a big loss in my mind. Using the same field preserves backward compatibility, 
is more compact in bytes, creates performance problems, changes all mapping 
of what things means, etc. IOW, this makes things much worse.
