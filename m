You personally don't, the IT and security compliance industry does, it
seems to leave Linux security infrastructure in an interesting
conundrum.

For the record, just to be very clear as to what an LSM is allowed to
do under your administration, for our benefit and the benefit of
others:

An LSM asynchronously streams an encoding of every security event that
occurs into something in userspace, somewhere, that interprets those
events.  Is userspace allowed to directly signal the operating system
if it detects an anomaly in one of those events or a pattern of events
and at what resolution level can the signalling occur?

Fascinating response from someone given the privilege of
maintainership status of a sub-system in a project whose leadership
preaches the need to always work with and submit to upstream.

Even more fascinating when that individual publically states that he
is employed by the largest technology company in the world because of
that companies desire to promote the health and well being of the
Linux eco-system and community.

For the record, we don't respect any industry, we respect the need to
address the challenges associated with how we are currently doing and
thinking about things.
