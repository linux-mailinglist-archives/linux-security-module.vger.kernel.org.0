It's ok to mess around with securityfs to get it to work properly for
your use case, there's no reason to create a whole new filesystem just
because of one missing functionality.

No, that's not how kernel development works, it's ok to touch other
portions when needed, otherwise you duplicate lots of extra code and
functionality as you are doing here.  Please do not do that.

That has nothing to do with the kernel, sorry.

So you require people to trust your custom parser and format just
because you don't want to rely on a trusted tool that the whole world
depends on?

Again, not a valid argument, sorry, please use common parsing tools
otherwise you are guaranteed to make mistakes and everyone will have to
rely on your custom tools only, which is not something that you would
accept from any other kernel change.

And I don't see a link to the userspace tools anywhere, did I miss it?
