Hm, that's a good point actually.  I would say that one must be able to fully
administer it with free (in both senses) tools, which must be used (let's aim
for the moon) in an included testsuite.  However, that doesn't need to be true
of "any" support tools.  If the author wants to sell some improved tools,  I
think that's good.  But again, the free tools must always be able to configure
every aspect of the LSM.
