It's a little bit expanding the scope here, as the documentation existed al=
redy
prior to the patch set, but it's a fair comment that this paragraph is not =
clear
enough.  I tried to rephrase it.  Maybe this is better:

  As a consequence, it is possible that a process has multiple open file
  descriptors referring to the same file, but Landlock enforces different t=
hings
  when operating with these file descriptors.  This can happen when a Landl=
ock
  ruleset gets enforced and the process keeps file descriptors which were o=
pened
  both before and after the enforcement.  It is also possible to pass such =
file
  descriptors between processes, keeping their Landlock properties, even wh=
en
  some of the involved processes do not have an enforced Landlock ruleset.

Some example code to clarify:

One way that this can happen is:

  (1) fd1 =3D open("foobar.txt", O_RDWR)
  (2) enforce_landlock(forbid all ioctls)
  (3) fd2 =3D open("foobar.txt", O_RDWR)

  =3D=3D> You now have fd1 and fd2 referring to the same file on disk,
      but you can only do ioctls on it through fd1, but not through fd2.

Or, using SCM_RIGHTS (unix(7)):

  (1) Process 1: Listen on Unix socket
  (2) Process 2: Enforce Landlock so that ioctls are forbidden
  (3) Process 2: fd =3D open("foobar.txt", O_RDWR)
  (4) Process 2: send fd to Process 1
  (5) Process 1: receive fd

  =3D=3D> Process 1 can not do ioctls on the received fd,
      as configured by the Landlock policy enforced in Process 2

Or, simply by inheriting file descriptors through execve:

  (1) Parent process/main thread: Spawn thread t
    (t.1) Enforce Landlock so that ioctls are forbidden
          (This policy is local to the thread)
    (t.2) fd =3D open("foobar.txt", O_RDWR)
  (2) Parent process/main thread: join (exit) thread t
  (3) Parent process/main thread: execve and inherit fd!

  =3D=3D> The child process can not use ioctls with the inherited fd,
      as configured by the Landlock policy before

The same is also possible with the truncation right.
