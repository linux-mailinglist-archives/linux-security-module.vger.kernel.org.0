Actually 80/90 VIS gear lube isn't all that exciting, but we did have
some excitement.

Given that the 40 MPH sustained wind coming across the lake was making
MIG welding impossible [1], I drug the broken part of the lift into
the garage with the electric winch on my pickup and started welding on
it.  The MIG gun went dead and I flipped up my helmet to see what was
going on and my 95 year old Dad was leaning on his walker after
throwing the main breaker switch in the garage.

I told him he had ruined my bead and he said I had two five gallon
cans of gas sitting behind me.  I told him I had checked to make sure
the caps were on so we were good to go.

I haven't seen him that excited since Uncle Larry started welding on
the broken tongue of our homemade trailer that had three pallets of
gunpowder and a bunch of bee boxes on it that we had just hauled up
from Iowa [2].

As well we should.

Which is why TSEM has no interest in whether it is first, last,
fourth, sixth, ninth or somewhere else in between, we would embrace
someone choosing for us.

Our preference, only internally, for going first is that when TSEM is
in an infrastructure verification role, such as extended attribute
verification, and since the last time we checked first fail terminates
the LSM call chain, it seemed prudent with an eye on safety (we are
big on safety out here in the Upper Midwest) to bail as fast as we can
and issue a loud warning if there was evidence the LSM infrastructure
or integrity status of the operating system had been tampered with.

Casey, this is a time for you to have legendary impact on Linux
security, well beyond LSM stacking and SMACK, you choose for us... :-)

It is no doubt a question that is simply secondary to our novitiate
status in all of this.

There was an LSM list thread started by, I believe a Korean Linux
integrator.  I believe they were on an Ubuntu OS base platform running
AppArmor and running a containerized Fedora implementation to
experiment with SeLinux, I don't remember all the details, the
exchange would be on lore.  They were somewhat disconcerted by the
fact that when they threw the switch on SeLinux in the Fedora
implementation things pretty much collapsed around them.

Paul replied back and said that the LSM doesn't know anything about
namespaces, so the impact of enabling SeLinux was OS wide.  He
commented further that the above scheme could be implemented but there
would have to be very sophisticated mutual exception policies in place
between the two modeling strategies and composing something like that
would be the domain of experts in the field.

I had replied back to Paul and indicated that it was our understanding
that with LSM stacking you get the union of all the implemented
security models.  We had posed the question, in this hypothetical, if
an unconfined system wide SeLinux policy would be needed to disallow
all action by SeLinux, except for subject/object interactions that
would occur in the subordinate OS instance, but I don't remember
seeing a response, we may have missed it.

Are we missing something in our interpretation of how this needs to
work?

Now off to cook sunfish for breakfast.

Have a good remainder of the weekend.

[1]: For those who pretty much only do computers.  I is largely
impossible to aluminum MIG weld in a high wind.  It disrupts the argon
shield gas flow and the molten aluminum reacts with the oxygen in the
air and forms aluminum oxide that cold caps the weld since the melting
point of aluminum oxide is higher than the melting point of the
aluminum base metal.

[2]: Yes, TSEM originates from a very rural part of America and we wear
that on our sleeves.
