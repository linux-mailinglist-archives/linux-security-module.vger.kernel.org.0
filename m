I'm not playing any cards, I am simply advocating that TSEM needs to
be viewed through the lens of multi-dimensional numerical modeling, a
framework that you are uncomfortable with.

To that end.

One of our project advisors, who manages a large containerized
microservices shop, has been following all of this.  He phoned me and
questioned if the problem could be that you were viewing TSEM as a
whole system solution rather than a modeling solution based on
limited scope modeling.

Just for the record, is it clear that we are working on limited scope
modeling environments?

With respect to this failing before, could you give us a literature
citation that we could review that discusses the failure of previous
systems that were using generative functions to uniquely label each
security event based on the cryptographic identity of the executable
code that is generating the event?

To support further discussion, it would be helpful if you could
document the spectacular failure mode you would anticipate in the
framework of classical security discussion.

TSEM, like other security architectures, has basically two failure
modes:

1.) False positives.

2.) False negatives.

3.) Implementation complexity failures.

False negatives are arguably the most dangerous.  Something was
allowed to occur that should not have been allowed to occur.

When a workload is trained, either a security coefficient for a
security behavior is generated or it is not.  Thus, when the model is
enforced, generated coefficients either exist or do not exist in the
outcome set.

If the coefficient does not exist, there is a chance that this is a
false positive due to insufficient training coverage.  The correction
is the same as in other architectures, fold the false positive back
into the training set.  Until that happens the behavior is constrained
from occurring.

By definition there are no false negatives, ie. an event that did
occur but should not have occured, since the only coefficients in the
training sets are those that are consistent with the training
behavior.

Implementation complexity focuses on the ability of the technology to
either be deployed at all, or more importantly, deployed properly due
to lack of industry skills or infrastructure support.

We would look forward to elaborations on the specific failure modes
that would occur.

In industry it is referred to as the application of tanslational
technologies.  The notion that advances beyond current practice in a
field can achieved by the novel application of methods from other
technology disciplines.

See my 2017 invited presentation at the NSA's High Confidence Software
Systems conference.

Also, see the impact of the application of Singular Value
Decomposition on machine learning and classification.

Once again, as we noted above, if you could, please forward to the
list citations that specifically reference failure modes of numerical
modeling of security events to assist further discussion.

Personally, I never thought it would come down to this but here you
go:

I have a pet squirrel named Rocky that I have owned since it was a pup
and its mother was killed crossing Douglas County Road 7 in front of
our house.  He lives in a small kennel in our house.

Every day I take Rocky outside and open the door to his kennel.  Rocky
runs around the yard twice and then up an oak tree and loads his
cheeks with acorns.  He comes back to his kennel, eats his acorns and
falls asleep until the next day.

One night Jay Evil sneaks into the house, abducts Rocky and replaces
him with his evil squirrel Rabid, who looks exactly like Rocky but
fell out of a tree on his head when he missed a jump from one branch
to another and hasn't been right since.

As usual, the next day I take what I think is Rocky out into the front
yard and open the kennel door.  The faux Rocky runs out into the yard,
chases down, attacks, kills and begins to eat our German Shepherd
Max.

Conclusion, this squirrel's behavior is suspicious and should be
remediated.

TSEM, as a high granularity modeling architecture, would interrupt the
process when the squirrel began to chase Max.

You suggest or you have proof?

Once again, audit2allow is a tool for folding false positives back
into a security model.  Mathematically, it is designed to provide the
row and column definition of a false positive security violation in an
access vector matrix.

TSEM creates a high precision bounded training set of known good
security behaviors from a high dimensionality basis set.  This
training set is used to constrain subsequent executions of the
workload on which it was trained.

audit2allow was a tool that was implemented to compensate for
complexity induced limitations of SeLinux.

TSEM is designed to eliminate the need for such a tool.

SeLinux in permissive mode operates after the fact to correct a model
that was incorrect in its design.

TSEM is designed to produce a high precision definition of what a
workload should do.  High precision definitions are less prone to
false positives that have historically proven to be the reason that
security controls are disabled and thus rendered ineffective, despite
their technical superiority.

As I noted above, you operate from a mindset of classic subject/object
mandatory access controls rather than from the notion of numerically
modeled security behavior.

Future students of technology will note that Linux moved through three
phases of security architecture development:

Subject/object based mandatory access controls.

Pathname based controls.

Model based controls.

TSEM is the the first major implementation of the latter type of
control for the Linux kernel.  We accept resistance to the appearance
of these types of controls, the same thing happened with pathname
based controls.  The resistance doesn't mean the technology is
invalid.

The technology industry is moving towards model based security
controls, for a variety of reasons, too numerous to be litigated in
this context, so lets consider just one.

Without question, SeLinux is world class security technology.
However, by virtue statements of individuals like Kyle Moffett, it is
designed, by experts, to be implemented, by experts.  That model is
inconsistent with the world we find ourselves in, both from a
personnel and a technology context.

Companies that can run well tuned SeLinux implementations, for free,
turn it off and instead install security solutions, based on behavior
observation and modeling, that they have to pay significant amounts of
money for.

TSEM is designed to provide better and more trouble free access to the
data needed to drive model based workload controls.  Nothing we do
constrains the ability of anyone to implement an alternate security
model of their choosing.

Have a good week.
