There is a use case for not having strict parsing in the cloud world where 
there are multiple versions of OS deployed across a large number of 
systems say 100,000 nodes. An OS update can take weeks to complete 
across all the nodes, and we end up having a heterogeneous mix of OS 
versions.

Without non-strict parsing, to fix an issue in a policy we will need to 
update the various versions of the policy (one each for all OS versions
which have different IPE policy schema). We will lose the agility we 
need to fix and deploy something urgently in the policy, the nodes might 
be failing some critical workloads meanwhile. All the various versions of 
the policy will need to be changed and production signed then deployed 
etc. Further some versions might introduce newer issues and we will need 
to see what all versions of the policy have that bug.

I propose keeping the non-strict option as well to cater to this use case. 
Let me know your thoughts on this.

Regards,
JK
