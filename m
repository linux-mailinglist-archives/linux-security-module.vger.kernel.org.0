[CCing Linus]

Hi, top-posting for once, to make this easily accessible to everyone.

Stéphane, many thx for your insights.

I'm CCing Linus on this, as I guess he wants to be aware of this.

Normally I try to sum up things somewhat when doing so, but this here
likely won't end well. So all I'm saying is: commit 157a3537d6bc28
("apparmor: Fix regression in mount mediation") [v6.7-rc1] that was also
included in v6.6.3 broke containers in some setups. John described that
commit with the words "it is a far from good solution. It is a stop
gap." and later mentioned that "a CVE is coming for this and that having
this unmediated in the tree isn't good either."

For more details please check out the thread that on lore started with
this message:

https://lore.kernel.org/all/CA+enf=u0UmgjKrd98EYkxFu7FYV8dR1SBYJn_1b0Naq=3twbbQ@mail.gmail.com/

Ciao, Thorsten (wearing his 'the Linux kernel's regression tracker' hat)
