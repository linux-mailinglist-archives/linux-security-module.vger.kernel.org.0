I don't know a lot about SNP, but are we talking about the same secrets? SEV's LAUNCH_SECRET command allows the guest owner to inject any binary blob, though through the current OVMF implementation it is limited to one page.  These can be used for anything - encryption keys, private keys for signature, passphrases, etc. The SNP secret is used for communication with the PSP only? 

Can the two co-exist?

Generally I'm OK with this, but I want to support plain SEV as well. The current suggested snp-guest driver is only activated on SNP (if I read the code correctly).  Now the question is whether a general SEV (or confidential computing) driver makes sense? It looks like only parts of its functionality will be available depending on the actual hardware available.


> Should we cover usecases where SEV guest is not booted under the EFI ?

This sounds interesting; it might be useful for Kata were we try to minimize the overhead of the VM, so fewer moving parts is better.  So far we don't know how to boot an SEV guest without OVMF (=EFI).  Is this supported with QEMU (we currently inject SEV secrets using QEMU's sev-inject-launch-secret)?  Can you share such instructions?

I designed the sev-secret driver to be hardware-indepedent (maybe a better name would be confidential-computing-secret); it just looks for the declared secrets page and creates a userspace API to read the secrets by GUID.  In that sense, binding it to specific hardware will limit its usage with other platforms that can "prepare" the secrets in the correct place.
