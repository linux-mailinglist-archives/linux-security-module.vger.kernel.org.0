Obviously everyone is interested in sharpening their own knives so the
first challenge will be defining where this theme of measurement and
attestation needs to go.

Our focus in all of this is from a platform behavior modeling
perspective.  Our objective is to design platforms/containers that are
capable of self-disciplining themselves in the event that they exhibit
behavior inconsistent with the wishes of their designer.  Container
measurement trivially falls out of this model.

With respect to measurement namespaces, the first problem to be
addressed is what takes custody and responsibility for the measurement
events.  In classic IMA this is, of course, a TPM.  In our model we
use a Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) as this entity.

The TEE makes a decision as to whether or not the kernel should label
a context of execution as being a 'bad actor' if it indicates a desire
to exhibit a behavior inconsistent with a previously defined model.
As I noted previously we have an SGX based solution that provides this
infrastructure but have designed and are moving to a micro-controller
based alternative, given the fact that SGX is now moving to a 'cloud
only' solution.

One of the pain points in all of this appears to be whether or not a
measurement stream from a container should feed into the root
measurement of the platform or be fed into a measurement/monitoring
domain that can be attested against the root measurement of the
platform.  Based on our experiences the latter model is the only one
that is feasible or makes sense from an attestation perspective.

So it would seem that a generic approach to directing the target of
the measurement events would be the first objective.  If there is
interest we can make a copy of our patch available as it supports both
models.
