Why not? as you say, chain of trust is broken: the kernel itself is
not immediately integrity protected and neither is the firmware. Hence
filtering out keys in this case is really pointless.

I think it makes sense to honour explicit knobs, such as
MokListTrustedRT: It has a very clear meaning: it indicates whether to
import the keys or not.

This is quite different from SB state, which is not explicit about
importing keys at all, it just indicates whether firmware level
validation of signatures is done or not.

Yeah, it does not carry immediate security value if SB is off. But it
does allow finer-grained control by pre-boot code of how the kernel
later sets up things. Hence I'd keep it.

The revert I posted will allow us to populate the kernel keyring used
for dm-verity signature checks from pre-boot even if SB is off. Via
local or remote attestation during boot we can later validate this
chosen boot path, and hence can a-posteriori validate that everything
is OK even if the a-priori SB check is not done. But once we have
validated that we then have the key in the kernel keyring for later
dm-verity validations, which is all we wanted.
