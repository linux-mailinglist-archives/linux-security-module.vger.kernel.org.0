Yeah, I completely get this. My feedback this is: we can definitely
consider TEE based trusted keys, and I know that trusted.ko is a mess,
but still that is the only right long-term path. Think about the
positive side: if you as a side-effect can make it cleaner and more
versatile, your patch set will improve the quality of the kernel as a
whole i.e. you benefit larger audience than just TEE user base :-)

I can, yes.
