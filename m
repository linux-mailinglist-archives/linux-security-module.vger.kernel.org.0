I think we could keep the enum itself private to the kernel, and 
internally each security module could map the values to whatever 
permissions it wants to define.  SELinux itself has the ability to 
add/remove/re-arrange its permission definitions without breaking 
userspace/policy; they are dynamically mapped at policy load time. If a 
given permission doesn't exist in the loaded policy, there is a policy 
flag to control whether the policy should be rejected, or the permission 
should always be denied, or the permission should always be allowed. 
There is also support for an extensible set of "policy capabilities" to 
control whether new/changed permission checking logic for a given 
permission/operation should be enabled for that policy or if the kernel 
should continue using the older logic.

I would expect that distros and users would have to make pragmatic 
tradeoffs in this area, and it would be nice if they could have a choice 
beyond all-or-nothing.  Do all of the interfaces being locked down 
expose the same degree of confidentiality or integrity risk?

That seems to violate the intent of lockdown as I understood it, and 
turns security_is_locked_down() into a finer-grained capable() call.
Also, if I understand correctly, this could only be done if one were to 
disable the lockdown module in the lsm list, since the security 
framework will return non-zero (i.e. the operation is locked down) if 
any module that implements the hook returns non-zero; LSM is 
"restrictive". At that point, SELinux or the other LSM would be the sole 
arbiter of lockdown decisions.  SELinux or the other LSM also wouldn't 
have access to the kernel_locked_down level unless that was exported in 
some manner from the lockdown module.  Not sure how to compose these.

   This seems fine, except that there's potential nastiness

Not sure one can construct a useful policy at that granularity.
