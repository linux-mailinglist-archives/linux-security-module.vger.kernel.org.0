Right, I was envisaging the LSM replacing the default.

i.e. the default is tristate OR fine grained LSM policy.

They could in theory be composed restrictively, but this is likely not 
useful given the coarse grained default policy.  All the LSM could do is 
either further restrict none or integrity.

We'd need to figure out how to avoid confusing users in the case where 
multiple LSMs are registered for the hooks, possibly by having the 
lockdown LSM gate this and update the securityfs lockdown node with 
something like "lsm:smack".
