Like Kees Cook said, we don't need to worry about depleting the LSM ID space
because lsm_id::id is a u64. We only need to worry about cluttering/conflicting
the values.

A review might take years (like we did with the pathname based access control
in the past). What userspace would want to use of long-term non-persistent
registrations? At the stage of publishing an LSM (and userspace tools which
make use of LSM ID value), the LSM ID value should be long-term persistent
registrations. Recompiling userspace tools every time is no good.

Not silly at all. I do want to create long-term persistent registrations
against this space for any publicly available LSMs.

The sane and the better usage of LSM ID is to register any publicly available
LSMs. If LSM ID serves as an index for what LSMs are available in the world,
by maintaining "the LSM module name, the LSM ID value, short description about
that LSM module, the public git repository or web site for more information
about that LSM module" pairs, people can easily find what LSMs could be used
for their purpose, and developers can avoid re-inventing similar LSM modules
which are already available somewhere in the world (and optionally helps
avoiding module name collisions with any publicly available LSMs).

It is possible that more than 3 LSMs concurrently get under the review;
reserving 2 at most can deplete the reserved LSM ID space.

No userspace tools want to recompile due to unstable LSM ID values.
Temporary assignments is no good.
