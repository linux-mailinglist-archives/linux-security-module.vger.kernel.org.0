IMA is brought up on a regular basis with "we want to have this" for
years and then non-one seems to really care enough.

I'm highly skeptical of the value of ~2500 lines of code even if it
includes a bunch of namespace boilerplate. It's yet another namespace,
and yet another security framework.
Why does IMA need to be a separate namespace? Keyrings are tied to user
namespaces why can't IMA be? I believe Eric has even pointed that out
before.

Eric, thoughts?
