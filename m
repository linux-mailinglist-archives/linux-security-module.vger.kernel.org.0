Yes, the new hook should probably be called by attach_recursive_mnt().

Landlock tests should check with the legacy mount(2) and the new
move_mount(2) (e.g. with test variants).

That would be a valid attack scenario.  For Landlock, to make it simple,
non-recursive bind mounts should always be denied.

Shervin, please add this scenario in a comment for the Landlock
implementation of the hook.
