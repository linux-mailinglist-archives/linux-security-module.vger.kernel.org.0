I see.

1. Ensure that the attestation client stores the snapshot in a 
well-known and widely readable location.  There can be more than one 
attestation client, and all need access to the snapshot.

There is a privacy concern around making the snapshot world-read.

2. Is there a concern that, if the client doesn't run, it doesn't solve 
the kernel memory issue?  Is this relying on a UM process to solve a 
kernel issue?

How would that work?  The PCR read is UM, but IMA events are kernel. The 
UM operation cannot block the kernel or there can be a deadlock, right?

(UM) PCR reads can take multiple TPM commands, and they should not block 
an (kernel) extend.

I believe that the verifier needs the entire log the first time, whether 
there is a snapshot or not.  Shouldn't the snapshot process be opaque to 
the verifier?

Why does the verifier need this?  The first time, it asks for events 
starting at #0.  Next time, it asks for what's new.  It's independent of 
__where__ the log comes from.

A new verifier needs the entire log, no matter how many snapshots have 
been taken.

I don't think snapshotting affects the verifier at all. The attestor is 
a bit more complicated, but not significantly.
