To prevent the regression, allow the the existing firmware/UEFI keys to
continue to be loaded on the platform keyring, as it is currently being
done.  The new code would load just the MOK db CA keys onto the
secondary keyring, based on the new UEFI variable.  This is the only
code that would require a
"restrict_link_by_builtin_and_secondary_trusted" exemption.  The code
duplication would be minimal in comparison to the complexity being
introduced.
