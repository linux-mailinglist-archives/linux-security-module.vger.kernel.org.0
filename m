That's reasonable.  And I agree with John that, because of the way this
was "snuck in", if I were a distro building a tomoyo-enabled kernel, I
would now have trust issues.  But I don't think anyone else will come
to Tetsuo's defense, so I just wanted to point out that, while the
process was very much done wrongly, I think code-wise he's done the most
responsible thing he could - given his end goals.  Even so,

Well, this didn't occur to me last night, but what I'd be curious to
hear is whether Tetsuo has discussed this with RedHat.  Because unless
this makes them say "ok we'll enable that", it still doesn't help him.
And I don't imagine them agreeing to enable the CONFIG_TOMOYO_LKM.
