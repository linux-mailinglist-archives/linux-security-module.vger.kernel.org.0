Yes

Quiet is simpler (similar to the LANDLOCK_RESTRICT_SELF_LOG_* flags) and
if we get other ways to log actions this will also be used.  For the
supervisor case, that would be useful to not forward a request to the
supervisor.  The *_LOG_* flags could be used the same way too (even if
"LOG" may be a subset of the supervisor capabilities).  Do you think
that would be OK?  Dedicated flags would be more flexible but also a bit
more complex.  Is it worth it?  In any case, the semantic and need
should be quite similar.
