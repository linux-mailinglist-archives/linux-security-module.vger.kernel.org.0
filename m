Parts of that isn't really specific to Micron, is it? Sounds like
a per sector locking. AFAIR Tudor was working on advanced sector
protection.

I don't know the use case for MMC/NVMe, but until you convince me
otherwise, I see "sending raw commands to the SPI flash" as something
exceptional, and thus you'd taint the kernel.

This doesn't sound like a proper abstraction to me. Again, the per
sector lock protection should be integrated into the current locking
ioctls. Regarding the security commands, I'm afraid I can't help
you on that point, but it sounds like bypassing the kernel is the
wrong thing to do.
