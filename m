Agreed.  While I'm not going to be on a specific Linux release, I do
believe that at some point in the future the LSM stacking work is
going to land in Linus' tree.  Perhaps you'll never see it Steve, but
we need to prepare the code to handle it when it happens.

For my own sanity, here is a quick summary of the constraints as I
currently see them, please feel free to add/disagree:

* We can't have multiple "subj" fields in a single audit record.
* The different LSMs all have different label formats and allowed
characters.  Further, a given label format may not be unique for a
given LSM; for example, Smack could be configured with a subset of
SELinux labels.
* Steve's audit tools appear to require a "subj" and "obj" fields for
LSM information or else they break into tiny little pieces.

What if we preserved the existing subj/obj fields in the case where
there is only one "major" LSM (SELinux, Smack, AppArmor, etc.):

  subj=<lsm_label>

... and in the case of multiple major LSMs we set the subj value to
"?" and introduce new subj_X fields (as necessary) as discussed above:

  subj=? subj_smack=<smack_label> subj_selinux=<selinux_label> ...

... I believe that Steve's old/existing userspace tools would simply
report "?"/unknown LSM credentials where new multi-LSM tools could
report the multiple different labels.  While this may not be perfect,
it avoids having to multiplex the different labels into a single field
(which is a big win IMHO) with the only issue being that multi-LSM
solutions will need an updated audit toolset to see the new labels
(which seems like a reasonable requirement).
