My writing tends to be brief, hopefully concise.  I assume if you had
further questions you would have asked.

This pull request contained a lot of refactoring of the existing
appended signature verification code, so that IMA could retain the
existing framework of calculating the file hash once, storing it in
the IMA measurement list and extending the TPM, verifying the file's
integrity based on a file hash or signature (eg. xattrs), and adding
an audit record containing the file hash, all based on policy.  (The
IMA support for appended signatures patch set was posted and reviewed
11 times.)

The support for appended signature paves the way for adding other
signature verification methods, such as fs-verity, based on a single
system-wide policy.  The file hash used for verifying the signature
and the signature, itself, can be included in the IMA measurement
list.

Originally, IMA & EVM were limited to local kernel file systems, based
on i_version, but have been extended to support filesystems that don't
support i_version and for FUSE.  There are additional discussions for
extending IMA to support remote filesystems (eg. IETF NFS draft).  IMA
by itself isn't enough, since the remote file isn't pinned in memory,
but will need to be dependent on fs-verity.

Nayna Jain re-posted a patch set (v6) titled "powerpc: Enabling IMA
arch specific secure boot policies".  The changes are based on Michael
Ellerman's review.

thanks,

Mimi
