Somehow you have to tell a verifier to take a snapshot of the current state
of the PCRs when it replays the logs to be able to truncate the log. Whether
the state of the PCRs is in the log itself or it's just some sort of entry in
the log indicating a truncation probably doesn't matter for as long as the
verifying side keeps state of the PCRs at point of truncatiokn.

Also, the verifying side needs to take notice of the trustworthiness of the
system at the time the log was truncated in case the attestation client is
restarted and starts out sending the log with the first entry. The PCR state
shown at the beginning of the truncated log (when restarting the attestation
client) must then match when the 'notice' was taken and that determines its
trustworthiness at this point in the log.

That there's a kernel AK signature at this point doesn't seem necessary since one
presumably can verify the log and PCR states at the end with the 'regular' quote.
Nobody should ever trust a system by starting to look at the beginning of a
truncated log. You have to have evaluated all the entries in the log before and
determined whether the system was trustworthy. I don't think the kernel AK
quote buys much - at least not from what I can see.
