Which is a problem from a LSM perspective as we want to avoid hooks
which are tightly bound to a single LSM or security model.  It's okay
if a new hook only has a single LSM implementation, but the hook's
definition should be such that it is reasonably generalized to support
multiple LSM/models.

I guess I should wait until there is an actual patch, but as of right
now a VFS ioctl specific LSM hook looks far too limited to me and
isn't something I can support at this point in time.  It's obviously
limited to only a subset of the ioctls, meaning that in order to have
comprehensive coverage we would either need to implement a full range
of subsystem ioctl hooks (ugh), or just use the existing
security_file_ioctl().  I understand that this makes things a bit more
complicated for Landlock's initial ioctl implementation, but
considering my thoughts above and the fact that Landlock's ioctl
protections are still evolving I'd rather not add a lot of extra hooks
right now.
