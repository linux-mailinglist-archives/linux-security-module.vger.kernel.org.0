Loading MOK CA keys onto the "secondary" keyring would need to be an
exception.   Once CA keys are loaded onto the "secondary" keyring,  any
certificates signed by those CA keys may be loaded normally, without
needing an exception, onto the "secondary" keyring.  The kernel MAY
load those keys onto the "secondary" keyring, but really doesn't need
to be involved.

Loading ALL of the MOK db keys onto either the "secondary" or
"platform" keyrings makes the code a lot more complicated.  Is it
really necessary?

thanks,

Mimi
