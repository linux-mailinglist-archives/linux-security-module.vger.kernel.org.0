With the snapshotting approach the kernel doesn't need to maintain
ongoing access to a file, that is left up to the user process
performing the attestation (or simply inspecting the logs).  I have to
ask, for the third time now in as many hours, how does the proposed
kernel-holds-an-fd-open solution handle the case where the
file/filesystem is no longer accessible?  The snapshotting approach
should be much more resilient here as the error recovery paths can be
much more involved than what we would have available in the kernel,
not to mention the flexibility of allowing a user process to determine
how to store and manage the snapshotted log.

Considering that the snapshotting approach is opt-in (userspace has to
initiate the snapshot), I'm not sure the concern over log offsets is a
significant objection: existing userspace will never trigger a
snapshot, and new userspace that could potentially trigger a snapshot
should be written to take that into account.
