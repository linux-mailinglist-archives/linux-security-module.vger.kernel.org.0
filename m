We followed the lead of the SMACK and SeLinux LSM's, both of which
create the mount points for their control plane filesystems in
/sys/fs.

In addition, as a filesystem, we chose to have tsemfs closely follow
their design for continuity across the LSM's.  So they share similar
functionality and design, modulo of course, the event description and
trajectory export files that we will chat about below.

We can't use securityfs, secondary to the fact that it doesn't
implement pollable files, which are a requirement for trust
orchestrators based on external Trusted Modeling Agents.

So the question is, where would you like us to put the control plane,
I'm assuming on a mount point created in /sys/kernel/security?

Which would seem to leave the question of why some LSM's put their
control planes in /sys/fs and others elsewhere.

Mea culpa of course, the code now reads; 'Implements the tsemfs based
control plane'.

I think that sysfs tends to fall prey to the 'Kleenex' problem, with
control plane filesystems being generically referred to as 'sysfs'
filesystems, which of course, as you indicate, is technically
incorrect.

It appears you found the ABI documentation in the second patch that
was posted in the series, hopefully it was found to be complete, we
are currently in 13th position out of 494 files with respect to
quantity of ABI documentation... :-)

For the sake of 'lore':

After applying the patch series, the control plane API is documented in the
following file:

Documentation/ABI/testing/tsemfs

The TSEM LSM documentation proper will be in the following file:

Documentation/admin-guide/LSM/tsem.rst

Where we currently hold the poll position.

Personally, I've been working on Linux since late 1991, so we, as a
team, are well aware, and sensitive, to the issues and discussions
surrounding the file formatting decisions that were made with the
/proc filesystem.  So we did not make the decision with respect to
formatted output lightly.

In fact, I presumed that the top two things we would hear about with
respect to TSEM, would be about the introduction of CAP_TRUST from
Casey and the format of the event export and execution trajectory
files from you.

The issue is that the kernel needs to present to trust orchestrators,
a description of each LSM security hook, in the form of an atomic
update or transaction.

To help clarify the discussion, here are examples of records that are
output for a file_open and socket_bind hook event:

pid{1186} event{process=quixote-us, filename=/opt/Quixote/bin/runc, type=file_open, task_id=0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000} COE{uid=0, euid=0, suid=0, gid=0, egid=0, sgid=0, fsuid=0, fsgid=0, cap=0x3ffffffffff} file{flags=32800, uid=2, gid=2, mode=0100755, name_length=21, name=4829ead93d026770746f9cdebc76cc4d2a27f45db2d3ac436aa6fce4e2640415, s_magic=0xef53, s_id=xvda, s_uuid=feadbeaffeadbeaffeadbeaffeadbeaf, digest=7c1a43eb99fa739056d6554001d450ca1c9c184ca7e2d8a785bd1e5fd53bad8c}

pid{1204} event{process=ncat, filename=none, type=socket_bind, task_id=a5bc0eb22141657132f29e80ca6ea9b211e8443ead1f4b6b766935a14995040f} COE{uid=0, euid=0, suid=0, gid=0, egid=0, sgid=0, fsuid=0, fsgid=0, cap=0x20000420} socket_bind{family=2, port=28695, addr=0}

TSEM is currently modeling 84 LSM hooks.  We would certainly be open
to suggestions as to how we would architect the one-value-per-file
filesystem model in a manner that would scale, both with respect to
pseudo-filesystem complexity and system call overhead.

We will presume the documentation issue to be addressed.

The cover letter for the patch series, and the LSM documentation
itself, has the URL for the directory on our FTP server that has the
source code for the Quixote trust orchestration system as well as
compiled trust orchestration utilities and an SGX enclave, a Xen
stubdomain executable and micro-controller firmware for the SanchoSGX,
SachoXen and SanchoMCU implementations.

More specifically, the following URL's will, at the time of this
writing, February 2023... :-), pull the source and binaries:

ftp://ftp.enjellic.com/pub/Quixote/Quixote-1.4.tar.gz

ftp://ftp.enjellic.com/pub/Quixote/Quixote-1.4-1.x86_64.rpm

ftp://ftp.enjellic.com/pub/Quixote/quixote_1.4-2_amd64.deb

For some reason 'alien' bumps the release number when it creates the
.deb from the rpm.... :-(

After unpacking the source archive, the code that handles the parsing
of an exported security event description will be found in the
following files:

SecurityModel/EventParser.c

SecurityModel/SecurityEvent.c

SecurityModel/COE.c

SecurityModel/Cell.c

The formatted output was designed to be self-descriptive, extensible
and extremely low cost to parse, without the use of an external
library.  The same codebase runs in everything from a userspace
process, to a Xen stubdomin, through an SGX enclave and multiple
32-bit ARM micro-controller implementations.

The trust orchestration utilities that use the above code, and
implement drivers for the various Sancho trust roots, are in the
'Quixote' directory in the source tree.

As I indicated above, we are all ears if someone has a better idea on
how to handle the security event description export issue.

Have a good weekend.
