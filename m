Sorry, correction (+ABI, s/to/for/):

  This access right is available since the second version of the
  Landlock ABI.  This is also the only access right which is
  implicitly handled by any ruleset, even if the right is not
  specified at the time of creating the ruleset. So, by default,
  Landlock will deny linking and reparenting files between different
  directories, and only grant this right when it is explicitly
  permitted for a directory by adding a rule.
 
  When using the first Landlock ABI version, Landlock will always deny
  the reparenting of files between different directories.
