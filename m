True, the TPM is used as part of measured boot, but that doesn't
prevent it from being used in other capacities.  In this case the TPM2
NV Index was used just to store a public key and safely used based on
TPM 2.0 rules.

TPM based trusted keys can be sealed to a TPM PCR.  Only if the PCRs
matched, is the private key unsealed.   In that case, measuring
provides the trust for releasing the private key.  In this case, just
measuring the UEFI MOK variable and key does not prevent an unknown
public key from being loaded onto a keyring.   Once loaded it could be
used to verify any signed code's signature.
