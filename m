If an administrator/user needs to configure the audit subsystem to do
something, removing one line in a configuration file seems like a very
reasonable thing to do.  You can expect the default configuration of
every Linux distribution to fit every conceivable use case.

If an administrator/user wants this type of information in their audit
logs they need to be prepared to handle that information.

What?  That doesn't make any sense following what you said above.
You're starting to cherry pick quotes and apply them out of context,
which only hurts your argument further.

It makes perfect sense in the original context, see my comment above,
and perhaps go re-read that original email.

However, in this very same email, a few paragraphs above you conceded
that "The audit subsystem could handle the load".

We've already discussed this both from a kernel load perspective (it
should be able to handle the load, if not that is a separate problem
to address) as well as the human perspective (if you want auditing,
you need to be able to handle auditing).

Tetsuo, as should be apparent at this point, I'm finding your
arguments unconvincing at best, and confusing at worst.  If you or
someone else wants to take a different approach towards arguing for
this patch I'll entertain the discussion further, but please do not
reply back with the same approach; it simply isn't constructive at
this point.
