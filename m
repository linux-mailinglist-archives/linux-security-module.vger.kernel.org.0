This patch relocates the LSM hook function comments to the function
definitions, in keeping with the current kernel conventions.  This
should make the hook descriptions more easily discoverable and easier
to maintain.

While formatting changes have been done to better fit the kernel-doc
style, content changes have been kept to a minimum and limited to
text which was obviously incorrect and/or outdated.  It is expected
the future patches will improve the quality of the function header
comments.

 /**
  * union security_list_options - Linux Security Module hook function list
  *
- * Security hooks for file operations
- *
- * @file_permission:
- *	Check file permissions before accessing an open file.  This hook is
- *	called by various operations that read or write files.  A security
- *	module can use this hook to perform additional checking on these
- *	operations, e.g.  to revalidate permissions on use to support privilege
- *	bracketing or policy changes.  Notice that this hook is used when the
- *	actual read/write operations are performed, whereas the
- *	inode_security_ops hook is called when a file is opened (as well as
- *	many other operations).
- *	Caveat:  Although this hook can be used to revalidate permissions for
- *	various system call operations that read or write files, it does not
- *	address the revalidation of permissions for memory-mapped files.
- *	Security modules must handle this separately if they need such
- *	revalidation.
- *	@file contains the file structure being accessed.
- *	@mask contains the requested permissions.
- *	Return 0 if permission is granted.
- * @file_alloc_security:
- *	Allocate and attach a security structure to the file->f_security field.
- *	The security field is initialized to NULL when the structure is first
- *	created.
- *	@file contains the file structure to secure.
- *	Return 0 if the hook is successful and permission is granted.
- * @file_free_security:
- *	Deallocate and free any security structures stored in file->f_security.
- *	@file contains the file structure being modified.
- * @file_ioctl:
- *	@file contains the file structure.
- *	@cmd contains the operation to perform.
- *	@arg contains the operational arguments.
- *	Check permission for an ioctl operation on @file.  Note that @arg
- *	sometimes represents a user space pointer; in other cases, it may be a
- *	simple integer value.  When @arg represents a user space pointer, it
- *	should never be used by the security module.
- *	Return 0 if permission is granted.
- * @mmap_addr:
- *	Check permissions for a mmap operation at @addr.
- *	@addr contains virtual address that will be used for the operation.
- *	Return 0 if permission is granted.
- * @mmap_file:
- *	Check permissions for a mmap operation.  The @file may be NULL, e.g.
- *	if mapping anonymous memory.
- *	@file contains the file structure for file to map (may be NULL).
- *	@reqprot contains the protection requested by the application.
- *	@prot contains the protection that will be applied by the kernel.
- *	@flags contains the operational flags.
- *	Return 0 if permission is granted.
- * @file_mprotect:
- *	Check permissions before changing memory access permissions.
- *	@vma contains the memory region to modify.
- *	@reqprot contains the protection requested by the application.
- *	@prot contains the protection that will be applied by the kernel.
- *	Return 0 if permission is granted.
- * @file_lock:
- *	Check permission before performing file locking operations.
- *	Note the hook mediates both flock and fcntl style locks.
- *	@file contains the file structure.
- *	@cmd contains the posix-translated lock operation to perform
- *	(e.g. F_RDLCK, F_WRLCK).
- *	Return 0 if permission is granted.
- * @file_fcntl:
- *	Check permission before allowing the file operation specified by @cmd
- *	from being performed on the file @file.  Note that @arg sometimes
- *	represents a user space pointer; in other cases, it may be a simple
- *	integer value.  When @arg represents a user space pointer, it should
- *	never be used by the security module.
- *	@file contains the file structure.
- *	@cmd contains the operation to be performed.
- *	@arg contains the operational arguments.
- *	Return 0 if permission is granted.
- * @file_set_fowner:
- *	Save owner security information (typically from current->security) in
- *	file->f_security for later use by the send_sigiotask hook.
- *	@file contains the file structure to update.
- *	Return 0 on success.
- * @file_send_sigiotask:
- *	Check permission for the file owner @fown to send SIGIO or SIGURG to the
- *	process @tsk.  Note that this hook is sometimes called from interrupt.
- *	Note that the fown_struct, @fown, is never outside the context of a
- *	struct file, so the file structure (and associated security information)
- *	can always be obtained: container_of(fown, struct file, f_owner)
- *	@tsk contains the structure of task receiving signal.
- *	@fown contains the file owner information.
- *	@sig is the signal that will be sent.  When 0, kernel sends SIGIO.
- *	Return 0 if permission is granted.
- * @file_receive:
- *	This hook allows security modules to control the ability of a process
- *	to receive an open file descriptor via socket IPC.
- *	@file contains the file structure being received.
- *	Return 0 if permission is granted.
- * @file_truncate:
- *	Check permission before truncating a file, i.e. using ftruncate.
- *	Note that truncation permission may also be checked based on the path,
- *	using the @path_truncate hook.
- *	@file contains the file structure for the file.
- *	Return 0 if permission is granted.
- * @file_open:
- *	Save open-time permission checking state for later use upon
- *	file_permission, and recheck access if anything has changed
- *	since inode_permission.
- *	Return 0 if permission is granted.
- *
  * Security hooks for task operations.
