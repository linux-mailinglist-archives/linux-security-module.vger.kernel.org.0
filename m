IMA currently defines a system wide policy for measuring, verifying a
file's integrity (both mutable/immutable files) against known good
values, and adding audit records containing the file hashes.  The
policy isn't hard coded in the kernel, allowing people/companies to
configure it as desired for their specific use case.

Support for appended signatures already exists in the kernel for
kernel modules.  This pull request adds IMA support for appended
signatures in order to verify the kexec kernel image on OpenPOWER, as
part of Secure and Trusted boot enablement.  This would allow distros
to sign kernel images similar to how they currently sign kernel
modules.

IMA verifies file signatures up front, before allowing access to the
file.  fs-verity verifies the signature of the Merkle tree (and other
info), but does not verify the file data at the time of first use.
 There are pros and cons to each of these approaches.

Mimi
