Hi Casey, thank you, I hope your week has been going well.

As Paul noted in the following:

https://lore.kernel.org/linux-security-module/20230608191304.253977-2-paul@paul-moore.com/

Microsoft employs him to maintain the Linux security sub-system, and
related infrastructure, secondary to Microsoft's concern over the long
term health of the Linux community.

Given that, it is disappointing that Microsoft isn't providing
sufficient resources to enable him to provide guidance to the
community they desire to support, regardless of that, we now have
'official' guidance as to the requirements for submitting a virgin
body of LSM code:

https://docs.kernel.org/process/submitting-patches.html

Paul notes the 'separate your changes' section as his only specific
recommendation for the submission of new code, that section recommends
that each patch represent a logical change.

A careful read of the document suggests that our submission did not
violate what is the 'official' guidance for virgin code submissions.

Absent the utility of specific guidance, Paul recommends reviewing the
mailing list for community norms and expectations, so we did.

The following URL provides a full reference to Microsoft's submission
of their IPE LSM:

https://lwn.net/Articles/969749/

Their strategy mirrored ours with respect to submitting each major
functional unit as a single patch, a strategy that was sufficient for
the review of Microsoft's submission, 16 separate times.

You take exception with a single include file containing structures
referenced by every compilation unit, indicating that a structure
should be introduced with the code that uses it.

For the good of the community, it would be helpful to have
clarification as to how you do that without including all of the
compilation units in a single patch, which would clearly be rejected
as an inappropriate submission.

Best wishes for a productive New Year.

As always,
Dr. Greg
