The fundamental difference is that (appart from unsupported allocation
mode/size) the latter never returns NULL and you can rely on that fact.
Our docummentation says:
 * %__GFP_NOFAIL: The VM implementation _must_ retry infinitely: the caller
 * cannot handle allocation failures. The allocation could block
 * indefinitely but will never return with failure. Testing for
 * failure is pointless.

Sure, go ahead. If you manage to remove all existing users of
__GFP_NOFAIL (without replacing them with retry loops in the caller)
then I would be more than happy to remove __GFP_NOFAIL in the allocator.

Not sure what you mean by these allocations but I am not aware that any
of the existing user would be really buggy. Also as I've said elsewhere,
there is simply no good way to handle a buggy caller. Killing the buggy
context has some downsides, returning NULL has others. I have argued
that the former has better predictable behavior than potentially silent
failure. We can clearly disagree on this but I also do not see why that
is relevant to the original discussion because my argument against
PF_MEMALLOC_NORECLAIM was focused on correct GPF_NOFAIL nested context
that would get an unexpected failure mode. No matter what kind of
failure mode that is it would be unexpected for those users.

Those are not really important situations because you are arguing about
a buggy code that needs fixing. As said above we can argue how to deal
with those users to get a predictable behavior but as the matter of
fact, correct users can expect never seeing the failure so handling
failure might be a) impossible and b) unfeasible (i.e. you are adding a
dead code that is never tested).

I thought you were arguing about bcachefs handling failure mode so
presumably you do not need to use __GFP_NOFAIL for those.

I am sorry but I am getting lost in these arguments.
