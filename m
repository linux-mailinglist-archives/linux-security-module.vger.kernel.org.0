Yes, that's clear. I only used it to demonstrate how a workaround for importing
key material into an encrypted key could look like.

Yes, and that's the main reason I'd like to use trusted keys with dm-crypt: a
much lower chance of exposing this key somewhere it could be extracted.

Some of our customers have systems in the field which use non-mainline patches
for access to the CAAM [1], which also have the downside of exposing the
decrypted key material directly to userspace. In that thread you suggested to
use trusted keys instead. With Sumit's work that rework is finally within reach.
:)


In those systems, we have data that's encrypted with a pre-existing dm-crypt or
ecryptfs key. As we update those systems in the field to newer kernels, we want
to get rid of those custom patches, but can't reencrypt everything.

So the approach would be to perform a one-time migration when updating a device:
- use our old interface to decrypt the key and 'import' it into a trusted key
- use keyctl pipe and save the re-encrypted key to disk
- destroy the old encrypted key
After this migration, the key material is no longer available to userspace (only
to dm-crypt).


Another use-case for supporting key import that we want to support is  analysis
of broken devices returned from the field:
- generate an encryption key per device in the factory
- encrypt it to a private key in escrow and archive it for later use
- import it into a trusted key on the device
- keyctl pipe it to a file on the device for use on boot

Later, when you need to do an analysis, you can get the key from escrow even if
the device cannot boot any longer.

Jan
