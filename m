The unfortunate thing is that I was not involved with asym_tpm.c review
process in any possible way, which means that at the moment I lack both:

1. Knowledge of crypto/asymmetric_keys.
2. How asym_tpm.c is implemented.

I only became aware of asym_tpm.c's existence last Sep [*].

I'll put to my backlog to try TPM asymmetric keys (earliest when I'm back
from vacation 08/10).
