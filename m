Sure, why not? It shows that you will also in future take care of it.

Yes. Will do.

We found such a setting super useful while working with targets where the keys are
zero'ed for various reasons.
There are cases where you want to use/test trusted keys even when the master key
is void. Our detection logic does not only print a warning, it refuses to load
blobs. So IMHO the config knob makes sense.

I'm pretty sure this was the main reason, but I can check again.

Ok. :-)

pr_fmt is not defined on purpose. include/keys/trusted-type.h defines already one
and I assumed "trusted_key:" is the desired prefix for all kinds of trusted keys.

The key has a minimum size of MIN_KEY_SIZE, but p->blob (being struct trusted_key_payload->blob[MAX_BLOB_SIZE])
is much larger.
So the assumption is that a DCP blob will always be smaller than MAX_BLOB_SIZE.

Oh yes. Makes sense!

Right. :-)

DCP has many modes of operation. Secure is one level above trusted.
For the gory details see "Security Reference Manual for the i.MX 6ULL Applications Processor".
I'm not sure whether all information my manual describes is publicly available so I
don't dare to copy&paste from it.

As David and I understood the logic, both OTP and UNIQUE keys can be zero'ed.
It is also possible that DCP has no support at all for these keys,
then you'll also get a zero key. That's why we have this check here.

Thanks,
