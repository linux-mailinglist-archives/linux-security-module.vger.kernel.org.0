Well, yes, but the patch series also includes namespacing securityfs. 
We have to get that right for all consumers, including the modular
ones.  So I think the way it works is we don't need a remove callback
in kill_sb() if we don't raise the dentry refcount in create.  However,
we still need to return the dentry to allow for stashing and we still
need to be able to cope with remove being called for the namespaced
entries ... for teardown on error in the IMA case and module
removal+teardown on error in other cases.

No, I don't believe it does ... however it does require a stash
somewhere.

adding vTPMs is a use case that people want to support, so I don't want
to get to that bit and find it all doesn't work.

I'm not saying IMA does, I'm just saying we still need the dentry
returned by the API in case a consumer does need to stash.
