Any new functionality added to the kernel, especially user visible
functionality or some sort of interface, adds a support burden.

It's a good thing that 'audtictl -d ...' exists so that one can
selectively delete audit rules from the kernel.  If someone wants to
preserve specific audit rules, that is the way to do it; 'auditctl -D'
is a very coarse tool and not something that is likely very useful for
users with strict auditing requirements.

I would boot the system with 'audit=3D1' on the kernel command line and
ensure that your desired audit rules are loaded as early in the boot
process as possible, before any long-running processes/daemons/logins
are started.  Honestly, that's simply a good best practice for anyone
who cares about maintaining a proper audit log, independent of the
specific use case here.

A silly amount of work has gone into ensuring that the audit subsystem
in the kernel doesn't lose records when properly configured.  If you
haven't already, I would encourage you to read the auditctl(8) man
page and look for the parameters that adjust the audit backlog
configuration.
