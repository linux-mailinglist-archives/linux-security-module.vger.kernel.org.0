Ah, the ctx_ was because these fields are all grouped in ipe in a 
context (ctx)
structure. An private version (pre-v1) had these grouped like:

    ctx={ pid=229 comm="grep" op=EXECUTE ... }

But during an internal review, it was brought up that the grouping is likely
non-standard and to cause more issues than its worth instead of just 
prefixing
the field with ctx_. Now that I think about it a bit more, the context is
implicit, so the prefix and grouping doesn't make sense.

I could do something internal in IPE that will create the context in the 
right
way. As far as inside the audit stack it looks like the closest analogue 
would
be common_lsm_audit - which fixes the type to be AVC. I don't think 
adding another
form of AVC is appropriate?

I could also either extend common_lsm_audit to accept a type parameter, or
make a more generalized function as part of the audit framework. Do you have
a preference? Paul, do you have a preference?

Wow. I didn't know about this - it should be pretty easy to change the 
fields
to follow this mapping. Almost everything has a correlation already. It 
looks
like there would be only one collision with hook being currently defined
with netfilter. Everything else would be new (e.g. rule), or could map
an existingfield.

It makes sense to add these fields; and it'd be taken care of with your 
suggestion
above to make the audit context just gathers this information in its 
own, consistent
way.
