Sure, but my point is that convincing RedHat that this is acceptable is
likely to be an uphill battle considering their effort to gain full
ro_after_init coverage for SELinux.

This part I overlooked. I forgot that Tomoyo is still not fully stackable,
so it isn't getting included in CONFIG_LSM= for the distros that do
build it.

An attacker with a read/write primitive would be able to locate and
write to "registered" (since it is not read-only), allowing them to call
tomoyo_register_hooks() multiple times.

See above -- calling tomoyo_register_hooks() after boot is entirely
feasible given a read/write attack primitive.

The tables actually don't matter as much -- an attacker could construct
their own table anywhere in kernel memory and pass that as an argument
for their call to tomoyo_register_hooks().

(This is actually one of the reasons I have pushed to have sensitive
functions like that be able to check that their passed-in argument is
contained in a read-only area, but that didn't get much traction[1].)

The __ro_after_init section is immediately neighboring the .rodata
section, so when .rodata is marked read-only (after __init has
finished), the kernel marks both sections read-only. (Except for, I
think, s390, which does two passes: .rodata is read-only before __init,
and then __ro_after_init is marked read-only after __init.)

> As a whole, I don't think tomoyo.ko approach is unacceptably dangerous.

I agree, this implementation is safer than I initial assessed (due to the
LSM's view of the hooks being skipped due to lsm= not including tomoyo).
I still think how this patch ended up in Linus's tree was a big mistake,
though.

Regardless, my opinion is unchanged: I think it will be harder to convince
RedHat to build in _this_ version of tomoyo compared to the stock version.

(Out of curiosity, does RedHat build in AppArmor?)
