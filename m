If a counter is needed, I would suggest placing it somewhere other
than the config file so that we can enforce limited write access to
the config file.

Regardless, I imagine there are a few ways one could synchronize
various userspace applications such that they see a consistent view of
the decomposed log state, and the good news is that the approach
described here is opt-in from a userspace perspective.  If the
userspace does not fully support IMA log snapshotting then it never
needs to trigger it and the system behaves as it does today; on the
other hand, if the userspace has been updated it can make use of the
new functionality to better manage the size of the IMA measurement
log.
