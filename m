Flattering, but a touch off the mark. In the 1980's there were at least
a dozen UNIX systems that implemented "B1", "B2" and/or "Compartmented
Mode Workstation" systems. Five of those even got NSA evaluation certificates.
There's plenty of expertise floating around today. The tools for doing
security analysis have moved from "grep" to "AI". The original TCB definition
for one system was done on paper, with a yellow highlighter, in a bar in
Cambridge.

Really, it's not that hard. It's messy and unpleasant and you learn things
you don't want to know. You find a lot of bugs and discover all kinds of
software behaviors that should never have been introduced. You become
quite unpopular with your peers with other interests. We were "lucky" in
the 1980's to have a US government executive order that drove security
into operating systems, giving us the rationale for making changes. What's
difficult today is justifying the effort.

The SELinux team did in fact propose removing the LSM infrastructure
and making their code the official extended security mechanism.

Nah, the technical prowess is there. The financial backing isn't.
Besides, it's a *lot* more fun to write a filesystem than an SELinux
policy (or set of Smack rules) for a distribution.

Sure. Everyone uses their front door. Very few are locksmiths.

SELinux + audit2allow. CONFIG_SECURITY_SMACK_BRINGUP.
These are helpful, but you're not going to get away without applying
some real brain power to your security model.

And that's my point. Generated security models are crap. The best
they can accomplish is to notice when a system changes behavior.
Sometimes that's a security problem, and sometimes it is the system
responding to anticipated changes, such as the phase of the moon.

The NSA once told me that "A system is secure if it does what it is
supposed to do, and nothing else". If you can't say in advance what
the system is supposed to do, you can't determine if it is secure.
