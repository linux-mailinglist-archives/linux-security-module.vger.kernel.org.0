Indeed I'm carrying this forward as Mark is no longer working on it.
My apologies for
missing those comments!

Can you clarify a bit more? The patch is definitely super noisy and I'd love
to have a better solution. The problem it's trying to solve is:
 1. Kernel-privileged init mounts /mnt/blah-lower and /mnt/blah-upper.
 2. Kernel-privileged init mounts /blah with overlayfs using the above dirs.
 2. Kernel-privileged init loads sepolicy off /blah/policy. Enforcing begins.
 3. Kernel-privileged init tries to execute /blah/init to initiate a
domain transition.
 4. exec() fails because the overlayfs mounter creds (kernel domain) does
     not have getxattr permission to /blah/init.

Eg, we're hitting this problem without even making changes to the mount, and
without anything being written to /mnt/blah-upper.

I'll need to think about this more and test to verify. It's not a scenario that
would come up in our use case (both dirs effectively have the same permissions).

If the answer is "yes, that can happen" - do you see this as a problem of
clarifying the model, or a problem of fixing that loophole?

In a security model like ours, I think there's no way around it, that
we really need
accesses to be from the caller's credentials and not the mounter's. It's even
worse than earlier iterations of this patch perhaps let on: we mount
before sepolicy
is loaded (so we can overlay the policy itself), and thus the
mounter's creds are
effectively "the kernel". This domain is highly restricted in our
sepolicy for obvious
reasons. There's no way our security team will let us unrestrict it.

Best,

-David
