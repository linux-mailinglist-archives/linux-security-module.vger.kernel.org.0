If user mounts are enabled, that comes with UID mapping, and device
nodes disabled - no?

Out of curiosity, what's keeping us from saying "user mounts are
generally expected to be safe" for XFS?

Obviously, that does expose a massive attack surface, so saying that for
a C codebase that wasn't initially designed for it has a high pucker
factor.

But I've been impressed with syzbot's ability to find bugs, so barring
architectural issues which I assume you'd know about it seems it's not
nearly as crazy a thought as it used to be - for XFS, as you guys have
been the most rigorous about hardening so I expect that's about as good
as it's going to get until we start rewriting our filesystems in Rust.
