People already mention that you seem to deliberately ignore advice
given to you and continue with your own narrative. Here's my last
attempt to explain things to you:

You are conflating two use cases, built-in out-of-tree LSMS and
modular LSMs. However, the proposed changes block neither of the use
cases.

* For modules that are out-of-tree but compiled into the kernel, they
can just modify the MAX_LSM_COUNT
* For dynamically loadable LSMs, you anyways want a separate
security_hook_heads. The __ro_after_init should not be relaxed on the
existing security_hook_heads to prevent any memory corruption from
overriding LSM callbacks, this lowers the existing security posture.
And then, in the call_int_hook and security_for_each_hook you can
iterate over both the static call slots.

^^ I said the above multiple times but you ignored all of it!
