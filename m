I myself is not a RHEL user. I use RockyLinux and Ubuntu for improving quality
of the upstream kernels via fixing bugs syzbot finds. (Unfortunately, currently
the "static call" change is preventing me from spending my resource for this
activity, for "static call" broke AKARI.)

My customers are RHEL users, and I'm working for their RHEL systems, with my
feeling that how their projects becomes easy if I can profile their systems
using TOMOYO. But my customers do not know about TOMOYO. I have no channel to
introduce TOMOYO to relevant persons who are in a position of giving
permissions for contacting Red Hat support using their RHEL subscriptions.

LSM is the best-fitting tool for my purpose.
You can see an example at https://youtu.be/5cgqbQI9bEM .

Without ability to do conversations, potential maintenance cost vs. ROI
cannot be evaluated. And I can't gain chances/ability to do conversations
with relevant people...
