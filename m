[ASIDE: Thanks for the heads-up Jon, I've also CC'd the LSM list as I
think this pull request is a surprise to all of us.]

I'm confused, or rather surprised to see this patchset/PR, and even
more surprised to see it has landed in Linus' tree.  While I suppose
we don't explicitly state that LSMs should CC their pull-requests to
the LSM list, there is definitely convention and plenty of history
here.  Even Tetsuo has previously CC'd the TOMOYO pull requests to the
LSM list (below).  Considering the history of TOMOYO pull requests,
LSM conventions, and the contents of the pull request, I can't help
but think the omission here was done with deliberate intent.  I'm also
surprised it was posted, and pulled, roughly two days from the end of
the merge window.

Apenguin-kernel%40i-love.sakura.ne.jp

Unfortunately this pull request was sent while I was traveling and not
in a good position to respond, or even properly notice it; as things
are I'm typing this email from the seat of a plane (the first time
I've had network access on a laptop since Thursday morning).  If I had
seen this last week I would have voiced an objection that this pull
request effectively duplicates the LSM framework hooks in TOMOYO (and
likely a few other things, I'm only quickly scanning the patches ...);
I wouldn't have accepted something like this in a new LSM submission
and I can only see this as a bad faith move on the part of Tetsuo.

Linus, it's unclear if you're still following this thread after the
pull, but can you provide a little insight on your thoughts here?  I
don't want to go down the "security people are insane" discussion
hole, but I'd would like to know where the line is drawn with
accepting changes like this: are you consciously supportive of
individual LSMs sidestepping the LSM framework like this when they are
not able to gain approval from the LSM maintainer and the LSM
community as a whole?
