Tingmao,

This seems like the best way to do it. Alternatively, I considered passing in just the
f_cred to the hook, but I'm leaning towards a more generic implementation like the one you
have below.

I think landlock already allows checking of existence of files even when when the process
doesn't have rights on them, so there is precedent for this so in my mind this would probably be OK.

Gunther:

I'd be happy to send you an updated LSM hook patch with the sock parameter.

Just let me know.

Tingmao:

For connecting a pathname unix socket, the order of the hooks landlock sees is something like:

1.  security_unix_find. (to look up the paths)

2. security_unix_may_send, security_unix_stream_connect (after the path is looked up)

Which for is called in DGRAM:

 unix_dgram_connect OR  unix_dgram_sendmsg 

and for STREAM:

 unix_stream_connect

IIRC, the path lookup only occurs in this order always, so in the logic as you have it the domain_is_scoped()
would be called twice, once from the security_unix_find when you call it in step two, and once from the
domain scope hooks. (If access was allowed from security_unix_find)

There are a couple of things to consider.

---

Audit blockers need special handling:

Here's an example:

1. Program A enforces a ruleset with RESOLVE_UNIX and the unix pathname scope bit, with no rules with that
access bit (deny all for RESOLVE_UNIX).

2. Program A connects to /tmp/mysock.sock ran by program B, which is outside the domain.

2. security_unix_find is hit to lookup the path, and the RESOLVE_UNIX code doesn't grant access to
/tmp/mysock.sock, so it calls domain_is_scoped

3. domain_is_scoped denies it as well, so now we must log an audit record.

When logging the denial, we have to include both blockers "scope.unix_socket"  and "fs.resolve_unix" for the
denial, because it is the absence of both that caused the denial. I think the refer right has similar cases for auditing, so there is precedent for this (multiple blockers for an audit message).

---

Dual lookup for domain_is_scoped. Consider this case:

1. Program A enforces a ruleset with RESOLVE_UNIX and the unix pathname scope bit, with no rules with that
access bit (deny all for RESOLVE_UNIX).

2. Program A connects to Program C's /tmp/foo.sock, which for the purposes of this example is in the domain of program A.

3.  security_unix_find is hit to lookup the path, and the RESOLVE_UNIX code doesn't grant access to
/tmp/mysock.sock, so it calls domain_is_scoped. Access is granted, and continues. (LSM hook complete)

4.  The connection proceeds past the path lookup stage, and now security_unix_may_send, or security_unix_stream_connect gets called. This requires ANOTHER domain_is_scoped access check.

While I don't THINK this introduces a TOCTOU, it is a little confusing.

This does mean that we look up the domain twice, if this is implemented naively. I think we can then just
skip the task credential checks then for security_unix_may_send and security_unix_stream_connect **for
connecting to pathname sockets**, since the domain_is_scoped will already have been called in landlock's
security_unix_find hook, eliminating the need for handling pathname socket domain checks layer on.

Gunther / Tingmao / Mickaël:

I have a potential idea to make this concept cleaner.

The docs for landlock currently say:


       IPC scoping does not support exceptions via landlock_add_rule(2).
       If an operation is scoped within a domain, no rules can be added
       to allow access to resources or processes outside of the scope.

So if we go with the solution where we are now saying IPC scoping DOES support exceptions
we will need to update the documentation, to say scoping for pathname unix sockets is an exception,
and have to have the "exemptible scopes" (like this one) alongside "non-exemptible" scopes
(ie the existing ones). This creates some friction for users.

If we foresee other "exempt-able scopes" (which are scopes that also support creating exemptions w/ corresponding access rights) in the future, maybe we should consider separating the two in the ruleset
attributes (I used scoped_fs as an example for the attribute name):

structlandlock_ruleset_attrruleset_attr={
.handled_access_fs=
LANDLOCK_ACCESS_FS_EXECUTE|
LANDLOCK_ACCESS_FS_WRITE_FILE|
LANDLOCK_ACCESS_FS_READ_FILE|
LANDLOCK_ACCESS_FS_READ_DIR|
LANDLOCK_ACCESS_FS_REMOVE_DIR|
LANDLOCK_ACCESS_FS_REMOVE_FILE|
LANDLOCK_ACCESS_FS_MAKE_CHAR|
LANDLOCK_ACCESS_FS_MAKE_DIR|
LANDLOCK_ACCESS_FS_MAKE_REG|
LANDLOCK_ACCESS_FS_MAKE_SOCK|
LANDLOCK_ACCESS_FS_MAKE_FIFO|
LANDLOCK_ACCESS_FS_MAKE_BLOCK|
LANDLOCK_ACCESS_FS_MAKE_SYM|
LANDLOCK_ACCESS_FS_REFER|
LANDLOCK_ACCESS_FS_TRUNCATE|
LANDLOCK_ACCESS_FS_IOCTL_DEV,
.handled_access_net=
LANDLOCK_ACCESS_NET_BIND_TCP|
LANDLOCK_ACCESS_NET_CONNECT_TCP,
.scoped=
LANDLOCK_SCOPE_ABSTRACT_UNIX_SOCKET|
LANDLOCK_SCOPE_SIGNAL,
    .scoped_fs = 
	LANDLOCK_SCOPE_FS_PATHNAME_UNIX_SOCKET
};

This more clearly distinguishes between scopes that have exceptions/corresponding fs rights,
and ones that don't. Later we could add scoped_net, if needed. I feel like this would be more
intuitive and better categorize future scoping rights. An obvious con is increasing the size of
the ruleset attributes.

Of course this separation is only worth it if there are other "exempt-able" rights in the future.
I can think of a few potential future rights which COULD be scoped and have corresponding rights
(binder, sysv-ipc, pipes, tcp/udp between two local programs).
