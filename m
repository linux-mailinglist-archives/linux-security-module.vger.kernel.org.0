The early RNG for small machines remains pretty bad, so I can understand w=

Yeah, stackleak has no viable alternative=2E It's effectively init_on_free=
 for stack=2E It's be nice if there were a way to do this with upstream com=
pilers (track call depth)=2E

I have no problem removing sanconv (no longer needed), structleak (zero-in=
it is more complete), and stackprot-tls (assuming it really is supported af=
ter GCC 12?)
