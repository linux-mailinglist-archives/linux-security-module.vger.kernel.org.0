[NOTE: there were two reply sections in your email, and while similar,
they were not identical; I've trimmed the other for the sake of
clarity]

The resources you mention are all objects which contain some type of
information (either user data, configuration, or program
instructions), with the resulting fd being a handle to those objects.
In the case of io_uring the fd is a handle to the io_uring
interface/rings, which by itself does not contain any information
which is not already controlled by other permissions.

I/O operations which transfer data between the io_uring buffers and
other system objects, e.g. IORING_OP_READV, are still subject to the
same file access controls as those done by the application using
syscalls.  Even the IORING_OP_OPENAT command goes through the standard
VFS code path which means it will trigger the same access control
checks as an open*() done by the application normally.

The 'interesting' scenarios are those where the io_uring operation
servicing credentials, aka personalities, differ from the task
controlling the io_uring.  However in those cases we have the new
io_uring controls to gate these delegated operations.  Passing an
io_uring fd is subject to the fd/use permission like any other fd.

Although perhaps the most relevant to your request is the fact that
the io_uring inode is created using the new(ish) secure anon inode
interface which ensures that the creating task has permission to
create an io_uring.  This io_uring inode label also comes into play
when a task attempts to mmap() the io_uring rings, a critical part of
the io_uring API.

If I'm missing something you believe to be important, please share the details.

Accessing the io_uring buffers requires a task to mmap() the io_uring
fd which is controlled by the normal SELinux mmap() access controls.

It should be possible to deny access to io_uring via the anonymous
inode labels, the mmap() controls, and the fd/use permission.  If you
find a way to do meaningful work with an io_uring fd that can't be
controlled via an existing permission check please let me know.
