Huh!  Honestly, when I read the thread, especially Jon's comments, I was
worried.  But getting a chance to look at the patch now, it actually
seems good to me.  No one is getting affected unless they enable
CONFIG_TOMOYO_LKM.  Even those distros which have been enabling TOMOYO
won't be exporting new hooks without a config change, iiuc.
