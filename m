"integrity of ELF loader" is _not_ checked. It's part of the kernel
and you trust that the kernel is valid, because you trust the
build tools that compiled that kernel.
The kmod signature only covers the contents of the kmod.
Now, kmods are typically targeted one specific kernel version
compiled with a specific config, but some folks do load the same
kmod on different kernels. So by checking integrity of kmod only
you're skipping on the loader. If symbols are not versioned
and crc checked bad things can happen (obviously no one should
be doing that), but signature doesn't protect against that.
Compare that with the bpf signature. The whole package is signed.
The loader and what it is loading with one signature.
I argue that this is a more secure approach than kmod signatures.

Think of it as a self-extracting zip archive.
The whole .zip is covered by one signature. Inside it has the code
to self extract plus all the files inside.
The extracting code is a loader prog. Which is a normal bpf
prog that is subject to the same verification rules.
The files are other bpf progs that are also subject to the verification.

...and the existing mechanism already does that.

The signature covers all components: loader, the map that assists
the loading and all progs and maps that are encoded inside that
loader/map tuple.

That's simply not true.
Please read the current code more carefully. There is cover letter
that describes what's happening. There are no hashes of programs.

That's not what it's doing! Read his patch. It's adding pointless
signature to the loader/map tuple. It does nothing to progs, maps,
relocations that will be created at the end when loader completes.

You need to realize that single loader plus single map is
an implementation choice of tools/lib/bpf/gen_loader.c.
It can do the same job with a single prog and no additional map.
Hence any kinda hard coded extra map signature makes no sense.
We're not going to burden the kernel with one specific implementation
detail of gen_loader.
Tomorrow we might change the gen_loader to use a triple:
prog+map+btf or any other form.
The existing approach allows all that extensibility and freedom
to change the gen_loader.

Neither is in cards as was explained countless times.
