These two should be probably inverted: deny..., allow...

Allow writing anything with security.ima
Allow writing new files

What if they should be legitimately used after the HMAC key is unsealed
and before switching to the persistent root file system?

No, the first patch is about adding the ability to verify files created
during each boot. For any other file, EVM returns INTEGRITY_UNKNOWN as
before. The second patch changes the behavior, as INTEGRITY_UNKNOWN is
considered as an error for the enforce-evm appraisal mode. The second
patch aims at making the system more secure, as no file would be
accessible unless it is verified.

It is true that configurations without digsigs won't work anymore but
the alternative is accepting any file until the HMAC key is unsealed.

Signing the ramdisk is for sure a possibility, but IMA would be
sufficient to provide integrity protection as it checks any file in the
ram disk.

Unfortunately I found an issue in patch 1/2. These changes should be
applied:
