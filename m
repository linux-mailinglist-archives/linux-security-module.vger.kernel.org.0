Not a crazy idea.  I had debated something similar, a reserved
"private use" or "experimentation" range; there is definitely
precedence for that in other areas, e.g. network protocols.  What held
me back is that invariably folks will want to create long-term
persistent registrations against this space for their out-of-tree LSMs
which would require some sort of unofficial, adhoc registration
authority which starts to get a bit silly in my opinion (the
registration authority for the Linux kernel API is the upstream Linux
kernel community).

Temporary assignments while a LSM is undergoing the review-revision
cycle on its way to being merged is something different and if we need
a couple of reserved numbers for that (one or two MAX) we can consider
that, but I don't expect this to be a major problem in practice.  LSMs
that are in this transient pre-merge state shouldn't be used for
production purposes and thus a LSM ID change on merging shouldn't be a
problem.
