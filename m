You could do that=E2=80=A6 but the problem is created due to the pattern of=
 having a
single binary that is responsible for:

- Loading and attaching the BPF program in question
- Interacting with maps

Let=E2=80=99s set aside some of the other fun concerns of eBPF in container=
s:
 - Requiring mounting of vmlinux, bpffs, traces etc=E2=80=A6
 - How fs permissions on host translate into permissions in containers

While your proposal lets you grant a subset of CAP_BPF to some other proces=
s,
which I imagine could also be done with SELinux, it doesn=E2=80=99t stop yo=
u from needing
other required permissions for attaching tracing programs in such an
environment.=20

For example, say container A wants to attach a uprobe to a process in conta=
iner B.
Container A needs to be able to nsenter into container B=E2=80=99s pidns in=
 order for attachment
to succeed=E2=80=A6 but then what I can do with CAP_BPF is the least of my =
concerns since
I=E2=80=99d wager I=E2=80=99d need to mount `/proc` from the host in contai=
ner A + have elevated privileges
much scarier than CAP_BPF in the first place.

If you move =E2=80=9CLoading and attaching=E2=80=9D away to somewhere else =
(i.e a daemon like bpfd)
then with recent kernels your container workload should be fine to run enti=
rely unprivileged,
or worst case with only CAP_BPF since all you need to do is read/write maps=
.

Policy control - which process can request to load programs that monitor wh=
ich other
processes - would happen within this system daemon and you wouldn=E2=80=99t=
 need tokens.

Since it=E2=80=99s easy enough to do this in userspace, I=E2=80=99d be stro=
ngly against adding more
complexity into BPF to support this usecase.
