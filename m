Agreed. EK is part of TPM identity. But to verify the log,
you don’t need to have physical access to the TPM. You need to have
access to just public part of EK and AK/AIK certs (TPM on the system
would sign the quote using the private AK).
I believe you already know this, just stating for the sake of
completing the conversation. :)

Yes. That aligns with my understanding of EK/AK in general.
Thanks for describing.

I believe you are suggesting creating a new AK each time you
want to sign a PCR quote. It is doable in TPM 2.0, and it provides
benefits like privacy and untraceability. But it comes with it’s own
costs – cost of generating new AK each time you want to sign,
maintaining mapping of AK and it’s signed quotes, maintaining
multiple public AK certs etc.

Yes.

I believe the Kernel doesn’t have to generate key while
taking the snapshot. In the current proposal, Kernel can simply get
the (unsigned) PCR quote and log it in IMA log as part of the
snapshot_aggregate event. We don’t need to sign the quote while
logging it in the IMA log as snapshot_aggregate. And the act of
logging that event in IMA log extends the PCR bank. Sometime later,
when a remote observer wants to validate the log – it can do it by
comparing against the PCR quote that was signed at that point.

The Kernel doesn’t need to know. And it still doesn’t matter.
The benefit of our approach is the PCR values that represent the
previous snapshot(shard) is now logged in the IMA log as
snapshot_aggregate, and the PCRs are extended again as part of
logging that event in IMA log.

Hope my above explanation addresses this point.
