From a security perspective, it seems very reasonable to me that an
LSM would want to potentially control which processes are allowed to
bind or connect to the coredump socket.  Assuming that the socket
creation, bind(), and connect() operations go through all of the
normal LSM hooks like any other socket that shouldn't be a problem.
Some LSMs may have challenges with the lack of a filesystem path
associated with the socket, but abstract sockets are far from a new
concept and those LSMs should already have a mechanism for dealing
with such sockets.

I also want to stress that when we think about LSM controls, we need
to think in generic terms and not solely on a specific LSM, e.g. BPF.
It's fine and good to have documentation about how one might use a BPF
LSM to mitigate access to a coredump socket, but it should be made
clear in that same documentation that other LSMs may also be enforcing
access controls on that socket.  Further, and I believe everyone here
already knows this, but just to be clear, the kernel code should
definitely not assume either the presence of a specific LSM, or the
LSM in general.

None of the LSM mailing lists were CC'd so I haven't seen the full
thread yet, and haven't had the chance to dig it up on lore, but at
the very least I would think there should be some basic controls
around who can bind/receive coredumps.
