Today, DB and MOK certs go into the platform keyring.  These certs are =
only
referenced during kexec.  They can=E2=80=99t be used for other things =
like validating
kernel module signatures.  If we follow the same pattern, the DBX and =
MOKX entries
in the blacklist keyring should only impact kexec.=20

Currently, Micka=C3=ABl Sala=C3=BCn has another outstanding series to =

the blacklist keyring.  I assume the use case for this is around =
certificates used=20
within the kernel, for example revoking kernel module signatures.  The =
question I have
is, should another keyring be introduced?  One that carries DBX and =
MOKX, which just
correspond to certs/hashes in the platform keyring; this keyring would =
only be
referenced for kexec, just like the platform keyring is today. Then, the =
current
blacklist keyring would be used for everything internal to the kernel.
