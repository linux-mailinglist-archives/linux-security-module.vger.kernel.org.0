Ah, I see. We already do that, see the want_init_on_alloc()
implementation here: https://patchwork.kernel.org/patch/10943087/

When the kernel allocates an object from SLUB, and SLUB happens to be
short on free pages, it requests some from the page allocator.
Those pages are initialized by the page allocator and split into
objects. Finally SLUB initializes one of the available objects and
returns it back to the kernel.
Therefore the object is initialized twice for the first time (when it
comes directly from the page allocator).
This cost is however amortized by SLUB reusing the object after it's been f=
reed.
