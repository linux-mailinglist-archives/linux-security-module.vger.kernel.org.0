Hi Linus,

Here's a set of patches from Eric Snowberg[1] that add support for
EFI_CERT_X509_GUID entries in the dbx and mokx UEFI tables (such entries
cause matching certificates to be rejected).  These are currently ignored
and only the hash entries are made use of.  Additionally Eric included his
patches to allow such certificates to be preloaded.

These patches deal with CVE-2020-26541.

To quote Eric:

	This is the fifth patch series for adding support for
	EFI_CERT_X509_GUID entries [2].  It has been expanded to not only
	include dbx entries but also entries in the mokx.  Additionally my
	series to preload these certificate [3] has also been included.

	This series is based on v5.11-rc4.

Notes:

 (*) These patches fix a security loophole rather than actual fixing kernel
     breakage, so they could theoretically wait for the next merge window
     if you prefer.

 (*) Patch 3 adds the extract-cert target a second time.  I think make
     should just handle this, though it could be better to add a config
     option specifically for building that program (it's used by multiple
     options).

Changes:
 - Changed Jarkko's acks to his kernel.org address.

ver #3:
 - Rolled in changes from Eric to fix conditional building issues[7].

ver #2:
 - Rolled in a fix to the second patch to include certs/common.h in
   certs/common.c[6].

ver #1:
 - I've modified the first patch in the series to fix a configuration
   problem[4][5], to move the added functions to a more logical place
   within thefile and to add kerneldoc comments.
