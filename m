Just write that the trusted key subsystem is responsible for generating the
keys.  And please fix the trusted keys documentation to properly document key
generation, or better yet just fix the trusted keys subsystem to generate the
keys properly.

As I said before, there's no need for kernel trusted keys at all in cases where
the TPM userspace tools can be used.  This is existing, well-documented process,
e.g. see: https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Trusted_Platform_Module.  You are
starting with a solution ("I'm going to use kernel trusted keys") and not a
problem ("I want my fscrypt key(s) to be TPM-bound").  So please fix this patch
to explain the situation(s) in which it actually solves a problem that isn't
already solved.
