I'm not against the numeric LSM ID itself. I'm against the policy for assigning
numeric LSM ID. The numeric LSM ID can become the correct way forward only if
the following problem is solved.



A market is not a location where only products that passed a patent examination
are available. There are always products which failed to pass a patent examination.
But you are trying to make products which failed to pass a patent examination into
unavailable state, by requiring each product to get a barcode number which is assigned
to only products that passed a patent examination. Such situation is a regression
compared to requiring each product to have a product name.

A Linux kernel is not a program where only codes that passed a patent examination
can be loaded and executed. There are always programs which failed to pass a patent
examination. But you are trying to make programs which failed to pass a patent
examination into unavailable state, by requiring each program to get an identifier
which is assigned to only programs that passed a patent examination.

LSMs are one of programs designed for the Linux kernel. That is, there are always
LSMs which failed to become one of in-tree LSMs. But you are trying to make LSMs
which failed to pass a patent examination into unavailable state, by requiring
each LSM to get an LSM ID which is assigned to only programs that passed a patent
examination.

"Using the macro name and not the number" is the catch-22 situation. The problem is
that LSMs which are under review for becoming one of in-tree LSMs (and LSMs which
failed to become one of in-tree LSMs due to the patent examination) cannot rely on
the macro from the code in the public git repository due to lack of a stable number
for that macro.

When someone wants to try the userspace tooling, you are saying that that someone
can use -DLSM_NUMERIC_ID_FOR_THAT_LSM_MODULE=... argument to gcc when compiling
the userspace, without saying the ... part. The consequence will be conflicts
between multiple LSMs and/or non-working userspace tools. This will not facilitate
use of the LSM interface.



Whether LSM ID is "consistent with other kernel APIs" is completely irrelevant.

The LSM ID must behave like PCI device IDs and/or entries in /etc/services .
That is, whether the device driver and/or networking services are available
in the upstream kernel is irrelevant. PCI device drivers which are not available
in the upstream kernel are allowed to be loaded. The LSM ID database must behave
like the list of all LSMs which are publicly available in the world, rather than
what LSMs are permitted to be loaded and what userspace tools can work.

The current LSM ID is designed for locking out all products which are not available
in the upstream market. The concept of LSM ID must be changed to allow any product
to be publicly available from somewhere in the world. Otherwise, use of numeric ID
(and the "LSM syscall patchset" which uses the numeric ID) is a complete garbage.



The LSM ID is not a API. The LSM ID is a publicly available database.
Passing a patent examination must not be a requirement for assigning a stable LSM ID.
The LSM ID numbers must be available to all publicly available LSMs.

That is, either get rid of the patent examination requirement (so that whatever
proposed LSMs can become in-tree as long as maintaining and supporting the new
LSM for an extended period of time are committed), or assign the LSM ID by an
independent organization rather than at the discretion of the maintainers and
reviewers (so that whatever LSM can obtain a stable LSM ID regardless of whether
that LSM succeeds in becoming one of in-tree LSMs).
