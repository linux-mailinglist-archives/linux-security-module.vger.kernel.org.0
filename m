As of today, I can use a prebuilt kernel, crate my own MOK key and sign
modules. What will be different?

I would name it as ".machine" because it is more "re-usable" name, e.g.
could be used for similar things as MOK. ".mok" is a bad name because
it binds directly to a single piece of user space software.
