Our goal in this case is to move away from having the dm-crypt key material
accessible to user-space on embedded devices. For an existing dm-crypt volume,
this key is fixed. A key can be loaded into user key type and used by dm-crypt
(cryptsetup can already do it this way). But at this point, you can still do
'keyctl read' on that key, exposing the key material to user space.

Currently, with both encrypted and trusted keys, you can only generate new
random keys, not import existing key material. 

James Bottomley mentioned in the other reply that the key format will become
compatible with the openssl_tpm2_engine, which would provide a workaround. This
wouldn't work with OP-TEE-based trusted keys (see Sumit Garg's series), though.

I don't see how this would help. When using dm-crypt with an encrypted key, I
can't use my existing key material.

Except for the migration aspect, trusted keys seem ideal. Only a single exported
blob needs to be stored and can only be loaded/used again on the same (trusted)
system. Userspace cannot extract the key material. 

To get to this point on systems in the field without re-encryption of the whole
storage, only the initial trusted/encrypted key creation would need to allow
passing in existing key material.

I assume you refer to
https://sourceforge.net/p/linux-ima/ima-evm-utils/ci/master/tree/README#l143
"Generate EVM encrypted keys" and "Generate EVM trusted keys (TPM based)"?

In both cases, the key used by EVM is a *newly generated* random key. The only
difference is whether it's encrypted to a user key or a (random) trusted key.

Best regards
Jan
