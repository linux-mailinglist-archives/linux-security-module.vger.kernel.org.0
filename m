Defining what would go into liblsm* is a task that has fallen to
the chicken/egg paradox. We can't really define how the user-space
should work without knowing how the kernel will work, and we can't
solidify how the kernel will work until we know what user-space
can use.

Sounds like the Hideous format, or a variant thereof, would be
fine for you, especially if you never parse it.

Process 11111 would see the AppArmor label when reading
/proc/22222/attr/current. The display value is controlled
by process 11111 so that it can control what data it wants
to see.

The display is set at the task level, so should be thread safe.

Just so.

Writing to display does not require privilege, as it affects only
the current process. The display is inherited on fork and reset on
a privileged exec.

I can see that making dbus-daemon have to decide which label of many
to pass on to its clients would be bad.

An option that hasn't been discussed is a display option to provide
the Hideous format for applications that know that's what they want.
Write "hideous" into /proc/self/attr/display, and from then on you
get selinux=3D'a:b:c:d',apparmor=3D'z'. This could be used widely in libl=
sm
interfaces.

I would see creating a friendly interface like this as part of
my mythical liblsm, but I see your point.

If providing the Hideous format makes library code easier or more
efficient I'm happy to make that happen. It can't be the default due to
backward compatibility, but it can be easy as
"echo hideous > /proc/self/attr/display".
