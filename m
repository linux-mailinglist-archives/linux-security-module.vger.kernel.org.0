Yes, but it looks like replicating a user space hack in the kernel.

For this use case, a pidfd would be appropriate to avoid

I was thinking about potential (far fetched) issues that
LANDLOCK_RESTRICT_SELF_PROCESS could cause to existing code.  The main
use case to only enforce a Landlock domain on one thread would be for
test purpose, but this is indeed not the case for kselftest (except for
explit pthread tests).  So yeah, not a big deal but it should be
mentioned in the commit message and the doc that without
LANDLOCK_RESTRICT_SELF_PROCESS, threads can remove restrictions that are
only enforced on their siblings.

OK, we don't need to freeze all threads, just to block thread creation.

What about that:
1. lock thread creation for this process
2. call prepare_creds() for the calling thread (called new_cred)
3. call cred_alloc_blank() for all other threads, store them in a list,
   and exit if ENOMEM
4. asynchronously walk through all threads, and for each:
  a. if its creds are the same (i.e. same pointer) as the calling
     thread's ones, then call get_cred(new_cred) and
     commit_credsnew_cred().
  b. otherwise, take a blank cred, call cred_transfer(), add the
     Landlock domain, and commit_creds() with it.
5. free all unused blank creds (most)
6. call commit_creds(new_creds) and return

Pros:
- do not block threads
- minimize cred duplication
- atomic operation (from the point of view of the caller): all or
  nothing (with an error)
- almost no change to existing cred API

Cons:
- block thread creation
- initially allocate one cred per thread (but free most of them after)
