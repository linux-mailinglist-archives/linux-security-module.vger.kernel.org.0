Correct, but this is also used by landlock_append_fs_rule().

For now yes, I prefer to keep it as is.

This is better indeed, I'll do that.

I designed it this way to only traverse a path once (instead of 
potentially 16 times), whatever the number of layers.

It's still useful to discuss about the current code. :)

It is kind of a slight *ABI* change because of the potential errno code 
change, but this is the kind of things that may change over time with 
the kernel because it doesn't change the way user space interacts with it.

This fix may change the errno but in a better way because it only 
returns EXDEV when a file copy is possible. This may be seen as a fix too.

Yes, as long as these files are not part of a ruleset.

I tend to agree but the rename checks would be buried in 
landlock_restrict_fs() and the test output would be more difficult to 
understand.
