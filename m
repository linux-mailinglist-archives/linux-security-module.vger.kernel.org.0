Hi Nikolay,

I share a similar view with Nicolas, namely that using a bitmap
implementation would compromise the goal of Lockdown.

After reading the threads below, I understand you aim is to block user
access to /dev/mem, but without having Lockdown integrity mode enabled
to block other reasons, right? How about using BPF LSM? It seems it
could address your requirements.
