There must be some kind of misconception here. None of the changes have
been submitted so far. They are only in my master branch. They briefly
went to linux-next through my next branch but as soon as issues were
reported I wiped them off from there (which happened like 2-3 weeks
ago). They haven't been part off any of my PR's.

There is nothing to revert.
