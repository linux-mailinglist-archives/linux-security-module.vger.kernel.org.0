Stop. Really, I mean it. I put significant effort into trying to teach
you how to submit a patch set that could be reviewed. You ignored it.
I can't speak to what an "unbiased observer" would conclude because
your behavior has certainly left me with bias. Rather than writing
full length novels about why you submitted patches the way you've
done it you might consider heeding the advice. Grrr.

While there is some truth to that, we're really quite flexible.
What we need to see is that there is some sort of security model,
and that the proposed code implements it. We also need to be able
to examine the proposed code to see that it implements the model.
You have rejected all suggestions about how to make your proposal
reviewable.

Oh, stop it. Look at how many LSMs have been added over the past
few years. Sandboxing and application controlled security are
"modern" security concepts that were unheard of when the LSM was
introduced. As I said before, security is a dynamic technology.
If it were not, we'd have a Bell & LaPadula kernel config option
instead of an LSM infrastructure.

Without the underlying access controls detection is rather pointless.

Any other approach, and they have been considered, fails miserably
and introduces a host of complications. Not to mention performance
de-optimization.

I shan't repeat the objections that have been raised, but I will
point out that you have done nothing to address them.

Wow. calling Linux a failure is a bit of a stretch, don't you think?

We've been over these issues many times. Go back and make some changes to
