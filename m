Thank you for resending the patchset, although a couple of
administrative things to consider for your next posting:

* Each time you post a patchset it is generally considered a best
practice to increment the version number, e.g. "[PATCH vX 0/2]" with
'X' being the version number.  This makes it easier to identify
specific revisions and ensure that everyone is reviewing the latest
patchset.

* It is a good idea to use the "./scripts/get_maintainer.pl" script to
ensure you have included the right people and mailing lists on your
submissions as your latest resend did not include the LSM list when it
should have.

With that out of the way, I wanted to make a quick comment on the
patch itself.  Currently LSMs do not support unloading, or dynamic
loading for that matter.  There are several reasons for this, but
perhaps the most important is that in order to help meet the security
goals for several of the LSMs they need to be present in the kernel
from the very beginning and remain until the very end.  Adding a
proper "release" method to a LSM is going to be far more complicated
than what you've done with this patchset, involving a lot of
discussion both for the LSM layer itself and all of the currently
supported LSMs, and ultimately I don't believe it is something we will
want to support.

I appreciate your desire to help, and I want to thank you for your
patch and the effort behind it, but I don't believe the kobject memory
leak you saw at kernel shutdown was a real issue (it was only "leaked"
because the system was shutting down) and I'm not sure the current
behavior is something we want to change in the near future.
