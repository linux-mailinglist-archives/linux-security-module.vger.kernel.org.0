That's how we do things in email, since you want a separate author for
the emailed patch than from the author of the email itself.

But git itself very much has that difference between "author" and
"committer" internally, and all the usual email application tools will
take the separate "From:" line from the email, and make that be the
author in git.

(And then the sign-off chain is where we describe the whole path,
because git only has the concept of those two end-points: the original
author, and the final committer, but no concept of the path in between
the two, nor does it have the concept of the copyright and license
agreement implications of the sign-offs).

Good. You will get credit for the pull request in the merge commit
itself as a "Pull xyz from Micah Morton", so that path of history gets
encoded that way.

But the sign-off chain is supposed to be there for each individual commit.

(I don't always notice those things, but afaik there is automation in
place in -next that should warn about commits with incomplete sign-off
chains. Did that not trigger for some reason in this case?).
