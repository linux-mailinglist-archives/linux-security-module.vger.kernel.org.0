It appears that Paul is extremely busy, so I thought the 'Quixote
Group' would try and offer some reflections that may help with your
efforts.

The most important issue in all of this is to understand that Linux
LSM's 'stack', they don't 'nest'.

If more than one LSM is enabled, their hooks will be called
consecutively until one fails or they all succeed.  There is currently
no concept of an 'LSM namespace' that would allow the actions of one
LSM to be isolated from a second LSM that is enabled.

So if you are attempting to run SELinux and AppArmor on the same host,
you need to reason through the effective security policy that results
from the combination of the SELinux and AppArmor policies.

We would certainly not profess to be the experts on LSM/SELinux that
Paul is but I believe the point he is making is that, in his opinion,
the only way to allow both policies to effectively co-habitate is to
use SELinux enforcement on the host system and AppArmor enforcement in
the container environment.

Lets see if we can reason through a hypothetical example that would
illustrate the issues involved.

If SELinux 'goes first', which will probably be the case, there will
be a need to have an SELinux policy in place that does not prohibit
the interaction of subjects and objects in the container environment,
otherwise you will get whatever the effective SELinux policy is.  Once
SELinux elects to not deny a security event, an AppArmor policy will
have the opportunity to make security decisions for the processes
running in the container environment.

As Casey has noted previously in this thread, creating this type of
environment will no doubt require some degree of sophistication and
expertise in both SELinux and AppArmor policy development and
implementation.

Hopefully the above will help facilitate further understanding with
respect to your efforts.

your work.
