A FUSE filesystem that stitches together the log shards from one or 
multiple files + IMA log file(s) could make this approach transparent 
for as long as log shards are not thrown away. Presumably it (or root) 
could bind-mount its files over the two IMA log files.

I don't think individual applications should trigger it , instead some 
dedicated background process running on a machine would do that every n 
log entries or so and possibly offer the FUSE filesystem at the same 
time. In either case, once any application triggers it, all either have 
to know how to deal with the shards or FUSE would make it completely 
transparent.
